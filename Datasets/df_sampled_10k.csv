0,"Sometimes i need a utility knife to carry with me. I also love that it's easier to carry a pair of sunglasses than a pair of sunglasses. The plastic is nice and strong and the color is beautiful. It's a little thin for a regular mesh bag but still great for carrying with me. The only negative is the color. I had to work on it a little bit to get it to match my new colors. I am not sure if it will be perfect, but if it is, I will be buying another pair. I use this for my elliptical workout. It is super light and easy to use. It fits my bike perfectly. It is a little difficult to use, but it works great. I bought these to use when I ride my bike at night. They are a little hard to pull off the seat but I do not have to worry about that. They work great and have been great for my husband's riding. These socks are a great quality and very comfortable. The material is soft and comfortable. They are also lightweight so you can wear them on a long bike ride. They do not appear to be very long and I can wear them on my back or on the head. I am very pleased with the quality of the socks and will buy more soon."

1,"I bought the Lysol No Touch Kitchen System because I hate touching the soap dispenser when I have yucky things on my hands while I am cooking.
I was happy with the ease of set up. Just click in the soap and turn it on!
The berry soap smell is nice, not overpowering.
My only negative is it took a bit to figure out where to put the sponge/my hand to get the soap to come out."

1,"This review is for the Blu Ray version of Anastasia.  Regrettably, there is not a DVD version included, but the Blu Ray is high quality with a few fun extra features (a couple of games, a drawing Anastasia tutorial, etc.)

All in all, a good buy, as long as the price stays low.

It is a great animated movie, but I won't give the movie a full review since most folks looking to buy the Blu Ray already have seen and love the movie."
1,Great value and well made! They added a lot to my parents' anniversary party and we plan on reusing them for a birthday part next month.
1,"I love lava lamps, but this is a terrible ""tank"" for a Betta. It is much too small, the bubbles will be too strong and move the water more than a Betta will like, and there is no room at the top for them to breath. And from other reviews, the cap on this is air-tight. Your fish will suffocate (all fish require oxygen, it's dissolved in the water and without any air holes, there will be no oxygen. ) And if it is air-tight, the bubbles will increase the pressure inside the ""tank"", leading to stressing the material and the fish which is under the water. If you want this as a novelty light, go ahead. It's ridiculously overpriced for that (you can get a small real lava lamp for 1/3rd the price) but do not use it for a fish ""tank."

1,"Absolutely fantastic product in every way.

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense. You just need these corners and 6 sticks of rebar (available at Home Depot or wherever) which are pretty cheap and take a good amount of bullet strike/slag from the targets. I hang two 12"" targets and an 8"" from it and it's rock solid.

I have used these pretty extensively and they look brand new. They are made out of the ""self-healing"" target material and it really does work well. I can carry the whole set-up (broken down) in the cargo hold of my Jeep Grand Cherokee with the seats up."
0,I guess it's o.k.? But it's a very good product.  My only complaint is the extra suction cup.  I wish it had a ring or something to hold it in place.I had to use this to cover my dog's car seat with extra padding. The material is thick and it's very thin. I also have a large dog and I think this has held up well. It does not have a lot of strong metal bars. I think I'll buy another one for my other dog.I have a 50 lb.

1,"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

BTW, I've got over 30 years of plumbing experience, so please don't take what I say with to many grains of salt. I am speaking from extensive experience. Good luck with your project..."
1,"These Lowas replaced a pair of Lowa hiking boots I had and loved for almost 15 years. The fit is perfect for my feet,roomy in the front,as hiking boots should be,without being too big.

1,"I hoped...and hoped...and tried this product in different combinations and sizes. On my granite tops, it's a total failure, except for the sticky residue that's lasted. Both of my climbing cats (neither are kittens), didn't care for the sticky stuff. My main jumper actually kept licking the tape. Haven't bothered trying it on cloth furniture, due to reviews. After taping $50 of this stuff, it's worthless. Perhaps for older cats, but then again, they don't jump like younger cats (not kittens in my home)"

The only reason I gave it four stars is that the plastic lid is too small for a tall container. I used this to make a little bread in the oven, and it worked out very well.

The only downside is that the lid is not as solid as the plastic lid on the Oster. I will say that I had to use a different lid to make sure it didn't break, and that is not a big deal for me.

1,"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.

After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.

Simple Maintenance is key:

If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it.
If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)

My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.

It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.

Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars."

It is comfortable and provides excellent control when walking because the leash attaches over the back instead of at the neck.  The padding is thick and soft.  all of the straps are adjustable going to the center line on his back and for the neck.  Goes on over his large head with ease then can be tightened if needed.  Best harness I've ever had, Roman is a happy dog."

The material is nice and soft and it is easy to clean. I wish it was stronger so it would have been more durable. I also wish it had a locking mechanism so it would have been more secure. My dogs love to chew on the items and they seem to like it too. I have used this for years and I have no complaints. I love these for our little finicky cat who is super picky.

1,"So this is real-life anime. Wow. I'm stunned. Where Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress failed, Tokyo Godfathers greatly achieves. I loved this film. It's real-life anime with characters most of us have been at one time. We've all struggled--some to the point of being homeless. We've all had defeating family issues. And we've all wanted nothing more than to get away; this movie captures both that fantasy and that reality in one anime package.

And the story itself is touching. How can you not feel for these homeless people as they struggle to get a child back to its rightful mother? These three very unique individuals struggle to no end, facing bodily harm, organized crime, AIDS, and a possessive father, just to get this tiny little child to a safe place, a home, where it can be loved. And all of their efforts comes across as genuine. Excellent."
1,"A most inspirational and fascinating journey through time. I received Agincourt as a gift and looked forward to reminding myself of my favorite Shakespeare Henry V quotes:  For instance on receiving tennis balls from the Dauphin of France, an unfunny French joke, Henry V said ""His jest will savour but of shallow wit, When thousands more weep than did laugh at it,"" or the classic rabble rouser before the battle ""For he today that sheds blood with me Shall be my brother;  be he ne'er so vile. ""  Barker strips the theatre from history. Her account is a fascinating exploration into the ambiguous political circumstances, the chivalry, the gruesome common sense strategy of war and above all the extraordinary courage and single-minded determination of one man. Anyone facing the toughest challenges, against insurmountable odds, should read Agincourt!  And when it gets tough ""Remember King Harry."

1,"Love, Lucy was a great book that I read along with my friends. There is travel, romance, college life, and self-discovery. I liked seeing Italy through Lucy's eyes and falling in ""something"" with Jesse Palladino. He definitely is crush-worthy.

One of my favorite terms from Love, Lucy was ""vacation flirtation"" - referring to the quick romance you experience while on vacation. This sounds like something my best friend and I would have termed.

I liked this story so much. There were times that I wanted more development, more answers to questions that I had about secondary characters, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Five Things I Want to Do After Reading Love, Lucy

  1. Travel abroad. This is a given. Grab a backpack and go!
  2. Watch Roman Holiday. Lucy mentions it a few times and recreates a scene for a picture. I've never seen it and now I want to.
  3. Read A Room with a View by E.M. Forster. Love, Lucy is an adaptation
  4. Watch a live musical. Or maybe just sing along loudly to a musical soundtrack.
  5. Read more books by April Lindner."

I have no idea how to fix this. I will update this post if I find a way to fix it. My only other complaint is that the handle is a little loose. If you have a large handle and it's loose you will feel a little pressure on your hands. If you have a large handle and it's loose it will be harder to grip the handle.
1,I wrote a review b4 but Amazon didn't accept it(I was horribly angry). So it wasn't published. I bought this costume for my 4yro daughter who was In love with it. Me I hated it. It's very shiny like foil. It tore in one day and kept tearing. It was a little big but that's how I wanted so it'll last. I threw it in the trash about 4 months after purchasing it. It really isn't sturdy or tasteful.  Hope you like my review now Amazon. Wish I took a pic of it before I threw it away.

I have had some other parents tell my that their kids liked fingerless gloves.  I remember liking fingerless glove when i was a kid, actually I have a nice pair as an adult, they are just cool, so get some."

1,"In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am."

The blades are not in the way, they are very thin and don't seem to have the edge that they are used to. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for a blade for a keychain or keychain holder. Great. I like that the spring is spring loaded and that the clips are easy to change. I love that it has a built in locking mechanism and that it can be programmed to either lock or unlock. I have not had a problem with any of the other attachments. The only issue I have is the battery compartment is not holding a charge."
1,"Merc is made of hard, clunky plastic. He is a larger size toy, not typical action figure size, so that was nice to see. He is nice for smaller toddler hands, as well as older kids. Telecoping eyes work and he has 8 different sayings. Miles can ride on top of him, if you have him as well. He will stand on his own without falling over. My only worry with it is that it seems like if you would drop him on a hard surface, the hard plastic could crack. Other than that, I think and Miles from Tomorrowland fan will love him."
1,I gave this 4 stars because it seems like a good story.  The problem was that it just isn't the kind of story I am interested in.  I made it about half way through but just couldn't go on. I am sure others will enjoy it.
1,Truly enjoyed Season 1 and found Season 2 as enjoyable. Same timeframe as Downtown Abby just a different class of people.
1,"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all. Skip this unit (however DON'T get a Ipod)."
1,"I'm using this with a Lutron dimmer that I got on sale and it does pretty well. It can dim down significantly before I notice flicker (and it's not that bad even then and no worse than most any other bulb). I don't hear any high-pitched noise from it like I have with some light bulbs when dimmer (I haven't scrutinized it that closely I suppose, but some lights are so noisy when dimmed that it's hard to ignore).

It's got a pretty wide angle and is as good or better in that regard to the halogen it replaced. I have one of these in the ceiling of a room about 8'x8' (which is fairly small) and it is easily sufficient for the whole room."

Nice feature to be able to adjust the volume setting you're comfortable with & no matter how high the setting is, you'll appreciate the noise cancellation when your shooting your firearms. The design is practical & comfortable. I've had these on for hours with no discomfort or irritation. If you're in a pinch for space to put these, they fold in to a very manageable size that can easily be placed in your range bag. One thing to note: you'll discover that placing the battery on each side of the headset is a little challenging. By that I mean you have to be a little forceful to pry the cushioned ear piece from the plastic headphone. Once you do the first one the second will be much easier. Other than that little bump in the road, this is a terrific product that I would highly recommend to interested parties."
1,Bought for my daughter's Barbie collection.  She was so thrilled to get this for her birthday.
1,"**received a copy from author exchange for honest review**

Okay in one word is WOW. This is the first I have read from Mary Smith and have to say this is not your usual sports romance book. What got me about this book that made it so easy to love was its characters. I loved that you have a person like Meadow who seems like she is at the top of the romance world she is just like all of us waiting for her Prince Charming. The storyline pulled me in and though it is the first in a series I am already loving it for there was so much more between Meadow and Kyson. The cute way they completed each other and easy way there were towards each other is what makes its characters so memorable. Kysons attitude about a cover model was genuine to the point of making him think of Fabio was hillarious. Meadow now is a woman I loved right away for she reminded me of me with insecurities, fear yet still with hope her one love will appear. Mary Smith just wowed me since this is the first I have read from will definitely keep up with her work. Get this book you won`t be disappointed from the camaraderie between its characters, the love between Meadow and Kyson even his teammaters were awesome. Can`t wait for Book 2 in this series."
1,"I buy (subscription) other Beyond canned foods but when I opened Beef & Spinach and I thought it must be spoiled. It had such a rotten smell, I opened 2 more cans to compare. They, too, smelled rotten - like a decayed tooth.  My dog didn't seem averse to the smell, but she's a rescued dog & will probably eat anything.  With some trepidation I gave her some.  Several hours later she had terrible gas, followed by diarrhea.  She has no problem w other flavors.
Also, I agree w those who have complained about packaging. Several deliveries have come damaged: light-weight  boxes torn, 3 cases per box so heavy postal person couldn't carry them to the house. Last week the cans were so dented some  actually were bent in the middle."

I wish I could get one of these for them.I bought this for my dog because he has a very sensitive stomach and it is very expensive for a dog.  I bought this for my dog because he is a very sensitive dog and it is very easy to put on and off.  I have to get it off of him as he is a very sensitive dog.  This is the only one I have ever used.

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush"

I generally buy quality stuff but this time I gave ""made in China"" a try since I'm only plinking with my .22, but these old eyes with my tri focals can't see sights very well so a scope seems to be what I need.
I know I could have returned it, I know I can't now since I've used pliers on it.

1,"Great theory, but poor construction.  It broke on day two after around 10 total minutes of use.  Two faults:  Poor gluing of the magnets under the alley and weak, unstable wood veneer used on the top surface of the lane......First the side magnet switch got stuck and would not come back up to the vertical position to set the pins up.  I took it apart underneath to find one magnet came out of it's circle and latched onto the neighboring magnet, blocking the triangle of magnets from rising fully to the top.  I reglued it and another one that was loose (only a string of glue kept it from popping out of its socket), and then added 2 drops of super glue to the sides of the others as well.  Problem #1 solved.  Then I noticed in a good light that the pin dots on the bowling lane were all raised slightly (about the size of a fingertip around each) and the king pin spot had a tiny crack in it.  The bumps obviously affect the roll, which is why the ball won't go where you aim.  The veneer must be very thin.  There should be a thin non-flexible substrate under this area, like a small aluminum or plastic sheet, to prevent the lower magnets from pushing the wood up.  OR, a ""stop"" installed in the plastic mechanism to prevent the magnet plate from rising any higher then the floor bottom, as without one the spring pressure bangs the magnets up slightly into the wood.  Still working on this problem.  Very disappointed."

1,"This is a mediocre yet tolerable romantic comedy. It tries to be like Romancing the Stone but it falls short. The acting isn't too great, the characters cheesy and the plot silly but it's watchable.

I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.

For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.

This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.

I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it. He looks good with a mustache!

I wasn't too impressed by how the film looked. It hasn't held up well at all in 20 years. This was made in 1992 but the quality of the movie makes it seem like it was made in '72."

1,"Having seen a few episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 I knew what I was in for.

First, there would be a science fiction movie that if measured on its own merits would be absolute zero.
Second, the various characters on the ""space ship"" would be compelled to see the movie..
Third, the soundtrack of the movie would either be eclipsed by the ""viewers"" sarcastic comments or in the case the soundtrack was too painful to listen to, the space ship characters would happily substitute more of their own ideas.

So sit back and give it a try.  Admittedly this was not my favorite episode of all time but it had plenty of fun for fans."

1,"I purchased the Hanes Men's Long Sleeve Crew with Microfleece Pant Pajama Set for my son.  For the price, the quality of this set is pretty amazing.  I bought a size large and both pieces fit perfectly.  My son is about 5'11"" and 170 pounds.  Recently, he's had a hard time finding pajama pants that are the right length. So when I found this set, I had to try it.  They're just perfect!  The plaid pajama bottoms that come with this set are extremely soft, comfortable, and warm.  They have an elastic band, as well as a drawstring, so they fit a variety of sizes.  I personally think that the long sleeve t-shirt is a stylish choice for the younger male that doesn't want to wear a matching button up pajama top in the same print and it's a heavier material than a regular t-shirt.

I'm going to pick up another pair, most likely in the other color that's available, because they're such a great deal at this price and the fit is true to size.  These are a great choice if you're looking for a little gift for any male in your life.  The soft, fuzzy bottoms would also be nice for a woman.  Just make sure you check the sizing!"

1,"ALERT! SOME REVEALS HERE!

Anyone coming to this film w/o having seen the previous movies in the franchise has no grounds for complaint. However, as a film in the series, it is still flawed on a number of narrative levels. I have not read the books -- I'm waiting for the series to come out on Kindle -- and so I can only speak to the stories as they have been presented in the movies. This is legitimate, as the movies *ought* to be a stand-alone narrative.

Fundamental story matters are introduced without explanation (the mirror fragment) or eliminated without blinking (only *6* horcruxes are ever named and ultimately destroyed, even though it was explicitly stated that there were seven. Also, recall that Harry is the ""unnamed eighth"" horcrux that even Voldemort did not know about, and thus cannot be counted on this list.)

I've a fair eye for such details, so when major details like these suddenly get added and/or subtracted w/o explanation, it creates a radical disruption in the movie for me. As a consequence, on first viewing this film was almost unintelligible to me. That takes some doing, and it is a doing that typically is not worth the effort.

That said, having seen part II in the theatre, returning to part I (which I've now viewed a couple more times) the entire story line makes more sense, and the gaps and flaws of part I are much less distracting so that the OTHER details of the story-telling can now shine through.

Those other details really are very well done. But the flaws in the film make those finer moments difficult, if not impossible, to fully appreciate on the first viewing."

The ankle is loose enough that I can tuck skinny jeans into them.  I'm a true size 5, and they're true to size, maybe verging toward a tiny bit snug in the toe box, but I'm going to keep them.

1,"I've read a number of true crime books, but haven't delved too much into movies.  I was actually steered towards this one - which I'd never heard of - by a review on another movie, so three cheers to Amazon reviewers for helpful recommendations!

The movie intrigued me for a number of reasons - true crime, drama, and John Cusack playing a character other than, well, John Cusack.  Don't get me wrong, I love the heck out of a socially awkward, passionate about music, good looking & articulate guy as much as everyone, but I was interested in seeing him portray a different sort of character.  He does so well, the average guy next door with twisted desires and dark secrets, pushed to the edge of discovery by Nicholas Cage, playing - well, not Nicholas Cage.  You know, the somewhat over the top slightly kooky guy?  Not this time.  It's a nice role reversal on the good guy/bad guy dynamic that they had in Con Air (which I'll need to watch again soon) with both parts played quite convincingly and realistically.

The theme and the setting of the movie is dark, a pallor cast over it from early on that makes you want to see if your monitor or TV has changed settings while you weren't paying attention.  The action mainly comes in the form of suspense, with some difficult scenes and little humor to break the mood, or even worse, mock the truth behind the tale.

Given that this is based on a true story, I felt it was written, scripted, and acted out with respect for what happened, and for the victims and their families.  Demons do live among us, sometimes frighteningly close, with angels as passionate about protecting people as the demons are about hurting them."
0,"I'm not usually a traditional web designer, but I decided to try this one for the first time. I had a lot of trouble with the basic design of the keyboard, especially the color. I tried the color on a white background and it was very disappointing. I would have preferred a more vibrant color with a tactile feel, but the color was not there. It was also very difficult to set up with the touch screen. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it was very easy to forget to turn on the touch screen when typing on it, which is a big problem with this keyboard. I do recommend it for anyone who wants a simple keyboard for their work. I have been using a gb 3x2 for over a year and have had no problems. This is my second gb 3x2 and I use it in the past and have had no problems with the addition of a screen protector. I use this with a Canon 5D Mark II and this has worked great for me.

It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it on the first day of the trip. The battery life is good, but it is not the best. It will charge the phone up to about 8 hours, but it does not last very long. I would recommend it for anyone looking to recharge their phone. I have no complaints about this. Works well, and the case is well made. Would buy again. This is a great little speaker for the price. The sound is good. The only complaint I have is that the audio cable seems to break when you push it, which is annoying. The sound quality is not great. I would have preferred a little more bass. Overall, it is a great little speaker. I would recommend it. Very nice. I just wish it had a bit more volume control. I've had a few of these for a few months now, and haven't had any problems.

The first couple chapters were so slow that I didn't know what to expect.  After a while, I started to get tired of reading the same old story over and over and over.

The second half of the book was so slow that I couldn't get into it.  I felt that the story was not worth reading.  It was just too long and boring.  I couldn't get into the story at all.  I was left wondering what was going to happen next.

I didn't like the book at all.  I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  It was like watching a movie that was not made into a movie.  I didn't like the way the characters were portrayed.  The dialogue was so immature and boring.  The writing was so lame that I just couldn't put it down."

For those that want to run Linux headless with grub.  By default, grub runs in a terminal and without anything plugged in it will pick a resolution that is lower than the video card can display which will stop it from booting.  If you configure grub to run in the console rather than a terminal, it will fix it.  Hopefully that will save someone from spending the hours I did to figure that out."

1,Excellent story.  Very plausible.  I hope to be able to read the whole series. Please continue to wright these fine stories.
1,"""It is the place that confronts me with the fact that truly accepting love, forgiveness, and healing is often much harder than giving it""

The story of the prodigal son is one of the most prominent parables Jesus tells in the Gospels. A young man rejects his father, takes his inheritance, and foolishly spends it. The son finally decides to return home hoping that his father will forgive him and accept him back as servant. Unexpectedly the father doesn't even wait for an apology. The father runs out to his son and throws him a huge banquet.

This parable is both comforting and infuriating. It's comforting to see the unconditional love of the father, yet infuriating that the father doesn't ask for an apology or make him work back his favor.

A lot of Christians today live in this paradox. They love the unconditional love of God but are irritated when God shows so much love and mercy towards our enemies. We even do not like to accept undeserved grace. Legalism is born from this idea that we must earn back God's favor and fortune. ""One of the greatest challenges of the spiritual life is to receive God's forgiveness."" Our hearts need not to be focused on searching for God or loving God more. We need to allow God to love us.

Nouwen spins the parable a bit in this book. We always look at where fit between the sons: are we the lost son that returns or the stubborn brother that doesn't love? Nouwen challenges us to think about the father. Yes, in the parable the role of the father is the Lord, but God commands us to be like Him. Are you capable of loving like the father? Accepting and forgiving without an apology?"

1,"Two big stars in so so film. Barbara stanwyck did some of the great films in hollywood from double indemnity to sorry wrong number,but this is not one of them. As an actress she has the ability to display criminal types and states of viciousness and depravity that traditionally males display and she is very believable. Thye problem is not only that it is a screwball comedy,and proceeds in a kind of unrealistic vein,but it does that,since all comedies have to have a bit of realism to it...anyways the movie is about a rich couple in which a man is jealous of his doctor wife seeing other male patients. The drama here though does not center around the female stanwyck being in a dominant role and subjecting or ordering the man about,she is all too nice and respectable in this film,almost angelic like. The movie dramatises more the scientific type displayed by the doctor as opposed to the male childish type character,one of emotionalism,a mental problem, a type wanting to exterminate.he's like murder inc(an old word for organized crime),insane asylum,gestapo...and the word 'peek a boo' meaning a child like mind...and that's really where the comedy in this film centers around and at films end we have the male character trying to open up to the
outside world,be more realistic and find a job,and thats when his relationship is saved and he emotionally matures,and she quits her medical practice and joins him in his new life. Really a spoof and its ok since the
stars breathe life in film,and its a very learned and has some intelligent ideas and they are played for laughs...but the characters change all too easily and picture perfect like to make it believable...but a fun film about the emotionalist child like mind and the scientific here occupying opposite genders..."

The trigger does NOT move. It's a dummy costume gun, nothing more. Some black spray paint can fix it right up for a quick make-do E-11 (inaccurate, but better followed by than the Hasbro). It's worth about $10 personally due to absolutely no functionality in movement, but for what I needed it for it will be fine.

1,"So many reviews that seem to be written by folks expecting a ""magic wand"".  I have three small dogs, the newest of which is a 3 month old puppy. He was a ""biter"": people, things, himself, toys, furniture legs.....  However, the biting of me and the other dogs, seemed to be out of fear.
The other things can be attributed to teething.
The collar had a calming effect on this little rascal in about 2 days. I actually put collars on the other two dogs (bought the reasonably priced 3-pack from Sentry), as they were stressed by the change in our little family. All three have had a positive calming experience from these collars. Again, these are not magic, but the pheromone collar ALONG WITH soothing and training, have worked wonderfully.
I also bought the Sentry pheromone spray and have a witness as to the difference we realized when cleaning the first ear on the puppy - without spraying the area, and cleaning the 2nd ear, after spraying the air we were working in. She said to me, ""It's magic in a bottle""!  What a huge difference! I will continue to use the collars and spray until we are through the ""puppy months""!"

Dress is very comfortable and made well!  High quality!  I did end of exchanging the dress for a medium to get a more snug fit as I like a really contoured look.  The fit was great!  I LOVE it so much I am going to buy it in the other color (Mint) listed as well."

1,"$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!"

I would say that if you are a size 7, they are going to fit you, but if you are a size 8, they will not. I have had them for a few months now, and I do think that they are very comfortable. They are not bulky at all, but if you are a size 7, they will make you feel very comfortable. These are a good buy.This is a good quality wallet.  I wear it everyday, and it is a perfect fit.

1,"*** 3.5 stars ***

 I don't know how I feel about this book. Don't get me wrong it was good - what I read of it anyway. I had to stop reading because for some unknown reason it made me sad. I knew something bad was going to happen. The sense of foreboding was overwhelming and I just couldn't take it. I stopped reading a chapter 17 and skimmed through the rest and of course something bad happened. I wasn't so upset about the kidnapping. I was far more upset about what happened between Juliette and Killian. It was heartbreaking. I literally felt the pain of it and I wasn't even reading the whole thing. However I found myself going back to what I skipped over and reading it. The grand finale at the end wasn't so great. It should have been more elaborate. That epilogue was meh. I was expecting more. It could have been an awesome book if there was more happiness. They were happy times but it didn't feel genuine because it had a looming darkness that overshadowed it. I don't know maybe it's just me. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I hope the next book is better."

The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty

This book tells the story of three women:  Rachel, Cecilia and Tess, and how they are connected in ways that are unknown even to them. Rachel's daughter was murdered as a teenager. Cecilia is feeling unsatisfied with her normally perfect life as wife and mother. Tess's husband has fallen in love with her cousin, so she packs up her young son and goes back home to her mother's. All three women are dealing with tons of issues, to varying degrees of success. These women are interesting and complex. There is a decent mystery plot to this book to keep readers engaged. At times this book is a tad predictable but that did not take away enjoyment from reading it. I liked Moriarty's book What Alice Forgot so I chose this one from Amazon Vine to review. I was not disappointed. I enjoy her writing style; it is easy and enjoyable to read without being fluff. Moriarty creates interesting characters that will keep readers hooked in her books. I recommend this book. http://melissasbookpicks. blogspot."

1,"Why I Picked It Up
By now you can deduce that I am interested in any book that involves musicians. So of course I had to pick this one up, especially considering the fact that it hinted at a best friends romance.

Plot

It was that and more. The story of Chloe and Noah was complicated to say the least and it hooked me in. Seeing their struggles, seeing the two of them fighting their attraction, and trying to live life in the spotlight kept me engaged from the very beginning.

Leading Lady

Chloe was a great character. She cared for Noah. She was excited to get a new start. She was happy and determined. On the other hand, she had a backbone and didn't take crap from anyone, especially her ex or Noah's ex.

Leading Male

Noah was sweet, talented, and humble which you don't find in many of the musician characters in novels nowadays. I absolutely fell in love with him and his charms.

Romance

I liked the way that Wicks evolved this plot. I loved seeing a bit of the back-story of the two characters, both individually and together. It really gave their relationship depth. Their relationship was fun with, of course, some drama. I loved the tension between the two of them for the first half of the novel. I enjoyed how their relationship grew more and more. And of course, I adored the fact that they were friends first and foremost. They were perfect for each other and complimented each other very well. I hope we see some of them in the companion novel.

Conclusion

Overall, Before He Was Famous was a great book about friends to lovers with a dash of famous musician: the perfect recipe for a great book."

I liked the ending, but I'm not sure if I will be reading the rest of the series. I did like the first book, but I will probably read the third. I was given this book by the author for an honest review. I love the way this author writes."

1,"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters."
1,"The compression shorts are of excellent quality.  After several uses, the durability and quality is not a question.  The protection is however.  The cup insert allows for movement of the protection, but well beyond what you'd need for competitive sports or MMA.

Garter/Supporter blows this out of the water in protection (and it also holds your socks!).

1,"You know what I loved about this book?  I never had to forgive the hero or the heroine for being an idiot.  Not once did they betray each other. Not once did they fail to forgive a shortcoming.  There was no subterfuge, no great misunderstanding.  It's just a story of a man, trying to win a woman's heart --and succeeding.

Margaret is firmly on the shelf at 30 when her brother inherits a Dukedom.  He decides to share his good fortune with his sister, offering a sizable dowry for her to finally snag a husband.  That money is just what Rhys needs.  But when he meets Margaret, he is taken with her quick wit and strong will... and he knows they would be a perfect fit.

Margaret wants a man to love her for more than the money her brother is offering.  And Rhys' financial problems are no secret, so it takes some time before she is assured of his affections.  But the sexual tension is good and when they finally come together, it's great.  There are a few foils for the couple along the way, but they're all external.  It's a short read... only a little over 100 pages... but a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  4 stars."

1,"This is my second set of these glasses.  The first lasted over a year before I decided to replace them.  Of the several different types of glasses I have tried these were by far the best, they fit well, fogging was minimal, and the molding did not obscure my vision.  This pair however only lasted a couple months (used about half a dozen times) before a plastic film on the lens began to flake off making them unusable.  I spoke with Amazon, they would not refund or replace due to it being over 60 days.  They suggested I contact the seller.  The seller it turns out is only a distributor and I was referred to ESS to complete a warranty claim.  I called them and was told I could get a replacement lens for about $20.  I told them that was unacceptable for something that should have and has in my experience lasted much longer than a couple months.  So after a few emails and about a month of waiting I did receive a replacement lens at no cost.

I understand that periodically manufacturing errors will occur even on the best products but it's frustrating when nobody wants to rectify the problem. Overall I'm happy with the product but very disappointed that Amazon, Sportsman Supply, and ESS were so reluctant to stand behind this product."

I had used the Bags on Board plastic bone and the fire hydrant holders in the past... the black bone one kept breaking and I kept finding that I was missing bags because the end cracked off randomly or the circle that holds it to the leash would break.  The hydrant one never broke on me but was a pain in the ass to get refilled.  So I thought why not try this bag...it's got a zipper and it attaches with Velcro to the leash...it's AMAZING!!  for the price, you can't beat it.  No more broken plastic parts or raw fingers from trying to refill the holder.  I have left the leash with holder in the rain a few times and so far so good!  LOVE IT!!"

This had never happened to me so I checked youtube for some advice. This did not go well and the rod was damaged getting the casing out. I logged on to Amazon searched for .223 decapping die. This POS was the only one found. I didn't read the details that this was a one size fits all piece of trash ( we all know one size fits all rarely works ) Since .223 was in the description it pulled it up and I the unknowing unexpecting consumer ended up buying a $16 paper weight.

1,"Our two labs roam our acreage doing their rabbit/mouse/fieldrat routine every day, come rain or shine no matter what the season.  They often came home in the summer afternoon covered in several types of burrs, fescue seed, mud covered noses, dirty faces, and tongues hanging out the sides.

But of course, they've brought home several kinds of ticks who had free loaded back to the homestead.  Going over every inch of their ""happy to see you, dad, I had fun"" bodies was a nightly ritual.  I say WAS because we then discovered the Preventic tick collars.

These collars are the greatest invention since the riding lawn mower!  Now the only ticks we see are the live ones crawling on top of their fur looking for just the right place to bite.  If one does happen to attach, it will be dead within 24 hours.

These collars last 90 days before they need to be replaced.  We put them on the dogs at the first of May when the first ticks appear (although I think the little suckers can crawl at -10 degrees on top of inch thick ice!) and then again at the first of August.  This application keeps the grinning duo tick free and both their lives and our lives much happier.  But I feel they kinda miss the attention of daddy tick hunting their bodies every day.

The dogs have never had the slightest skin irritation due to the collars but we don't but them on extremely tight.  I can still get four fingers under them.  The other nice thing about the collars is that if for some reason they get their collars caught in a fence or a limb, they are easily stretched so the dogs can get themselves loose without choking .  We've had one collar lost only once in the four years we've used the collars and although expensive to lose a collar, well worth knowing the dog wasn't hurt."

1,"Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and as described, so that's good.

The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip.

Pros:
They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away."

1,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well."

1,"I, too, have been a DeWalt user for many years, having moved to their brand when I felt the Makita line went substandard.  After deciding to move up to an 18 volt product, I spent months conducting research, going to wood shows, and actually trying out numerous lithium ion and non-litium ion 18 volt tools.  My final choice was this kit.  Here are some of the reasons why:

Batteries:  18 volt lithium ion.  Fantastic idea to go with lithium ion.  The charge lasts longer and will not dissipate over time.  In addition, the battery design (outer housing) is smart.  I do not need to click two buttons on the side to disengage the battery from any of the tools.  I simply need to click the one button on the front of the battery and the battery slides out.  Because my hands are small, this makes all the difference in the world.

Drill Driver - For my hands, this was the most ergonomically correct grip I found.  This drill feels great, does not fatigue my hands after many hours of use, and does not weigh as much as the competition.  The 18 volt battery does not add as much weight as I thought it would, and the tool balances in my hand perfectly.  In addition, I didn't think I would like having LED's built into the drill, but I really do like the additional light when I am working.  Excellent drill all around.

Recip Saw - Again, excellent feel and power.  I have used this saw to cut through a variety of materials without any lag.  The one button saw change also adds a nice touch.  Grip and balance are excellent, with the battery adding the perfect amount of counterweight to the entire setup.

As I mentioned earlier, I looked at all of the kits available.  For the price and the product you receive, I don't think you could find a better value for your money than this kit."

It seems to work great, cleans it fine and like any other CLP it works pretty well as a lube. I still use solvents to clean the bore and barrel but the amount of carbon this stuff pulls off everything else makes it seem like it works well as a solvent as well. This is a very popular CLP overseas and has been around for a long time but I had never seen it in the local stores here so I am glad I picked it up."

1,"The Glimpsing is an intriguing and haunting tale of revenge, love, hope, faith, courage, and the age-old battle of good vs. evil.

The author creates a very Twilight Zone atmosphere from the beginning of the book, with nods to Alfred Hitchcock, Rod Serling and Stephen King. Although I wouldn't classify it as a horror story, it incorporates the psychological horror and suspense for which the above three are recognized as masters.

Portia Childress, brought up by a mother who has the ability to ""glimpse"", see into the world just beyond our world, wants the one thing she can't find in her relationships with men: true love. How she deals with this unfulfilled need is the center of this tale.
The mysterious painting reminds me of aspects of ""The Picture of Dorian Gray"" and subsequent stories involving mysterious, ""changing"" paintings but this has its own unique flavor.

It is easy to identify with Portia's innocence and need but more difficult to understand where she went as result of it. Gabrielle, in spite of her own love for Jack, tries to remain loyal to Portia and to love her best friend. Jack's increasing feelings for Gabrielle only complicate the situation, bringing about some of the ensuing horrors.

My favorite character in this story, though a minor one was Jack's housekeeper, Janice. She has the wisdom to get an idea of what is going on after Jack first receives the mysterious painting, offers Gabrielle a way of dealing with her own guilt and ultimately is willing to risk dealing with something she is worried is beyond her ability to handle, because of her belief in doing the right thing.

This was a refreshing read, standing out among the current ""horror"" stories that I have read with its unique presentation of that battle between good and evil. Well worth the time invested in reading the book. Unfortunately because it would give away spoilers, I can't go into the details of the unique perspective presented in this story, but I think any fan of the horror/supernatural realm would enjoy the book"

1,"This is the same story as Jag but from Roxy's POV. There is a lot that you learn about Roxy and why she is the way she is. It really awesome to see things from her POV which made for a more well rounded story. She really is a strong person and I really admire her.
Jag and Roxy are definitely a unique couple. They started out basically hating each other (or close to it) and it basically boiled down to several chance meetings where they poked at each other. This was extremely amusing to read about. Jag has serious drug problems and unfortunately a huge part of that is is rock career and the people in it that put a lot of pressure on him. Not to mention his ex-girlfriend from before he became famous. Roxy grew up with a drug dealer father and brother who OD'd so she's seen that side of things and wants nothing to do with it. She turns out to be Jag's saving grace and the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Despite all their personal problems, they truly are a fantastic couple.
I loved how raw and emotional the story line was. It felt like it could be one of those documentaries about a real life situation. I felt deeply invested with the characters and hoping for a good outcome. It's definitely not for those that like all the flowery words and a perfect story because it's far from that. But in it's own way it is perfect because of all they both had to endure. I absolutely loved this book and I can't wait to read about the other band members. 5 out of 5 stars!"

During that time, I was immersed in anything 'samurai' related, so this film was, of course, going to be a personal favorite of mine. Now that I'm a bit more mature, however, I find enjoyment in the more subtle, underlying themes, and the Native American backstory of the protagonist. Either way, I am happy with this purchase."
1,"Chameleon is the tale of a planned alien invasion and an army team's effort to halt it. Although ostensibly part of a series, it is fine as a stand-alone story.
After an ominous prologue in 1925 we fast-forward to the present and to a military base located on an island from where a helicopter full of people destined for a mainland vacation takes off. Meanwhile, things go very wrong and the chopper returns to the island with all its passengers plus some military brass. From this point on the copter passengers are in a fight for survival against overwhelming odds. They can't possibly win ... or can they?
The book is well-written. Although I felt it was a wee bit slow in getting underway, when it did take off it was a whirlwind! The characters: plastic (in more ways than one), credible, with some likable and others less so - as in the real world. I definitely recommend this book!"

1,"Most readers of John Le Carre know him for his more publicized stories; not as many have read back to the beginning.  I started as many readers with the more modern day stories and then I went back and read the famous, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  Comparing the earlier Le Carre to the later day author is night and day.  So I decided to start at the beginning - Call for the Dead.

George Smiley is introduced to us in this book.  He is not the supreme spymaster at this point that he becomes later.  Some may argue this point, as his storied heroics from WWII are on display.  But he is not so confident of his skills or his governmental position.  His personal strife with the divorce of his wife Ann is described and this adds to his personality.  Smiley is not the king of the Secret World at this point and his inexperience is fun to see.

The story is very short on pages, but not on important developments.  At this stage of Le Carre's career, he could say much with few words.  The characters are surprisingly well developed in 128 pages.  The intricacies of the storyline are well thought out and the ending, if not totally surprising, is explained in detail - something that doesn't happen so often in Le Carre's later writings.

I found myself wired in to this story for no other reason that I felt I was watching the manifestations of some of the most famous spy characters in history - Mundt and Smiley.  I can't say that the story is so twisted that the reader can't figure it out, but I will say that the writing is so well done, that you can't help but read every word.  The reader can begin to see the mind of Le Carre as he takes a simple plotline and attempts to weave it a myriad of ways.

If you've liked the later books, treat yourself to this one - the creation."

1,"I was somewhat hesitant to read this book because I feared the language used by the author would be too distracting.  However, the story itself is so engrossing that my worries were needless (and undoubtedly the language itself is necessary to create the unique voice of Saba).  This novel is about Saba and her journey to recover her twin brother, Lugh, after he is kidnapped from their home at Silverlake.  Saba is very close with her twin brother and puts him on a pedestal...he is the light to her dark.  When the reader first encounters Lugh, he is a father-like figure, taking care of the day-to-day needs of Saba, their father, and their younger sister, Emmi.  Although Saba is very close with her brother, she does not care for her younger sister, Emmi.  She views Emmi as a weak, distracting child, who only gets in the way.  Once Lugh is kidnapped, Saba begins her quest to recover her brother and  quickly learns that she is a fighter who will do anything to protect her family.  Along the way, she also meets Jack and a gang of revolutionary girls called the Free Hawks.  We watch how she grows as a person and learns the importance of family and friends.  I highly recommend."

1,"From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

1,a neat movie....  although I like th newer one better...
1,"These rain boots are comfortable and cute. I usually wear a 7.5 or 8 in a regular shoe; I bought these in an 8. With socks on, the foot fits well around the arch, ankle, & heel (my mother, who has very high arches, did not find the arch as comfortable). The toe is roomy, but I like that. The ankle feels likes it's reinforced, so if you try to bend your ankle too much, it might feel weird, but that's true for many boots. If you walk placing one foot in front of the other (like you would if wearing dress shoes or on a runway at a fashion show), then the clips on the interior side of the calves are going to knock into each other and will likely come undone -- other comments have mentioned this problem -- but if you walk with your feet slightly apart, it's not a problem at all. The clips are not so large as to knock into each other if you make just slight adjustment to your foot placement.  After all, they're made for stomping around in rain and mud, not to be worn as dress shoes or at runway shows, even though they are cute enough for that. ;)  Overall, I like them and would recommend them."

Although it's a bit different from reading a regular book, the visuals are a definite delight. The artist seems to draw what I picture in my mind's eye. I have downloaded several in anticipation of a plane trip across country. As a much quicker read than a novel, I feel they will be perfect for passing time on my flight."

1,"I carry a knife just about everywhere on my property.  Currently, I carry a BK-11 with me.

This Schrade knife is too big for everyday carry for work on the property.  Best to strap this to your bag or in the truck.  It becomes a chore lugging it around.  But for what it is and at its price point, you can't beat it for an entry-level quality steel workhorse knife that you can beat up.  The handle becomes too abrasive for bare hands but with gloves, no problem.  The nylon sheath is nothing to write home about but it fits the provided sharpener and fire steel just right.  But in its sheath, the knife looks too ""clunky.""  The top button snaps do not lock easy.  I'm impressed with the knife."
1,"This sight was really impressive for the money. At ~20$ you could have a high-contrast bead. The circular contrast of fibers with the light channeling is what makes it pop. I shoot clays and have a few different brands and this bead would look nice on any of them. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect this thing to be gigantic. It seems compact because of the nested fiber colors, where a solid bead would take up the whole space. The odd thing to me was that the bottom is not completely flat. It has a small raised area near the screw post, maybe to keep it from rubbing off a finish? This will not hold on its own and does need some sort of adherent (loctite, etc.) As you can find on handgun forums, this is a great front sight post replacement for handguns too. I put it on a micro-compact 9 and it is not too big. the multiple thread sizes were great and I just opened the original hole  slightly for threading and had a 20$ high-contrast fiber post."

1,"I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done."
0,"I have gotten more of this than I thought I would. I also have the Clue. If you want to get a solid idea of the game, you can get it here. I have heard that the game is very similar to the one I played. The Clue is a great way to get familiar with the concept of the game. It has all the different pieces that you can see in the game and you can play with a group of people. The game is played by a group of people, but the game is about a group of people playing a game. It is more like a group of people playing a game. The game is fairly simple, but the basic rules are simple enough for you to understand. I think it is a good game to play with the group of people who are going to play. You can't really mess things up with the people who are going to play with you, but the people who are going to play with you will get bored of it very quickly. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good game to play with friends or family. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game that is not going to get bored with the game at first. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.

Her job is to track down the murderer, and she's one of the most dangerous detectives in the country.  In addition to being a detective, she's also a cop, and she's also the one who got the death penalty for a murder that happened on a train.

Annie Kingston once again finds herself in a fight with evil. But this time, she has something she didn't have before. She has found the power of God.

Chilling, thrilling, and totally entertaining, this third book in the series seems to wrap up some things, but I'm not so sure. I think there is reason to hope for another book.

1,"I enjoyed the book enough to finish it. I have to say though that I thought the mystery wasn't a mystery to me at all. I won't ruin the surprise just that I figured it out long before it came out in the story. I do love the way Lee Childs writes his stories and the Jack Reacher character.

The only parts of the book I detested or thought it added little value to the book was the mother parts. I thought it got in the way of an interesting read. He also talks to his brother in this book but it doesnt add up to much. It was overly long and drawn out..it seems like half the book is about the mom. My only thought on this book is that could have been a lot shorter. The book really dragged on for me. Most of the Jack Reacher novels feature fist fights, guns and a mystery. Good stuff. This one sadly has the focus on the mother. Their are some fights and some gun play but most of it is just emotions. I also felt like the very last end was kind of cop out. I mean people could put 2 and 2 together and get 4 mighty easy and our hero does life in prison. My opinion only. Still I had fun reading it."
1,"In 1851, childhood friends Amy Stevens and Matthew Kane travel with their families in a large wagon train bound for Oregon. Matt has long known he loves Amy, but shes only ever harbored brotherly feelings for him. As the massive trek begins, Matt makes his intentions known, but Amy rebuffs him. However, once the seeds of awareness are planted, Amy discovers that her attachment to Matt gradually begins to change. When Matts vengeful brother starts trouble, Amy is forced to hide the budding relationship because Matt insists on protecting her reputation.

1,"The shapes in Tetris are also known as polyominoes.  The Poly Pages site by Andrew Clarke has many constructions for various polyforms. The free program Burr Tools can let you explore more.

The puzzles in Doodle Fit use ""fixed"" polyominoes, which cannot be rotated.  This helps the enjoyability of these puzzles, since logic will often force a few of the pieces, and then the rest can be placed.

In each puzzle, a goal is given, and pieces that can make the goal.  The 5-way is used to place each piece.  Some semi-crazy black and white pattern shading is used on each piece.

There are 27 shapes in the beginners pack.  I got the first 17 very quickly, then had to think for awhile on #18. The higher level packs are locked until you solve earlier packs.

Much of it is readable by anyone with basic science courses; but remember reading your first year's physics books, the ones with physics problems at the end?  Take this up another notch, with requiring completion of second year math.

My peers went on to highly successful careers in engineering and sciences; I transferred to a liberal arts school.  I'm always highly suspicious of math equations to explain lots of things, and find this slows readings quite a bit.

Prince Arutha and his brothers are heros, and while I wish Feist had written more books about Arutha's exploits, I enjoyed reading about the coming of age of his sons. Erland and Borric, the king's spoiled brats, are sent as ambassadors to the country of Great Kesh mainly to teach them a lesson -- grow up! As usual, things go very wrong and the boys are separated, and then they find themselves fighting for their lives. In Prince of the Blood, Feist introduces Nakor, a new character of questionable character in the series, and with his help, Arutha's sons come out all grown up and smelling like a rose. Not to spoil it by mentioning names, but one character I loved loses his life in Kesh. Feist certainly is good about killing off characters when they've reached a dead end -- and sometimes before I am ready to say goodbye."

1,"An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment."

There isn't much in the way of a plot - a struggling father and husband buys a new bicycle in order to carry out the duties of his new job, the bike is taken away buy a passing thief, and the father and his son go out into the poverty stricken streets of Italy to find it.

However, it is a journey that they will never forget, as they bond with one another, and the father's weaknesses are ultimately exposed out of an act of desperation. It is an ultimately heartbreaking ending that caps off one of the best films that I have ever seen.

0,"This review could get better, but I thought it would be better to make a small review about the other two.  The first one is that the ring is not sturdy, and it's not as well made as the other one.  The other is that the two pieces are not the same height.  They are the same height, but the ring on the other one is more of a height mismatch.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little shorter than the other one.  I don't know why.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little longer than the other one, because the ring is not thicker.  The ring is not made of much material, and the ring does not have a ""ring"" on it.  I will update this review if I see anything else that is different.  I would recommend this set of rings.I really like these. They are very soft and soft. I use them to hang a sheet of fabric and they do the job. They are very soft and comfortable"

The only downside is that it's very hard to set up and then have a ""turn it on"" motion. It takes about 30 minutes to set up and it's not very easy to set up. I haven't used it with a remote and it's not very intuitive. I haven't had the chance to use it with a TV or TV antenna"

0,"I wanted a small bag that would be comfortable and comfortable for a travel trip. I was disappointed. I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area. He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which was perfect for him. He ordered a size XL and it fit perfectly!  I did have to give him the credit card since he has already been wearing it for a few months. He is on his feet all day long and so far he has been wearing it for a few hours. He said it is very well made and he loves it. I am happy with the quality of the product and would highly recommend it. The only negative thing is the shipping was a bit late for me to send it back. I will be returning it and getting a refund. I have no idea how long the shipping would take but I was very excited to get this bag. I would definitely recommend this bag to anyone. My only problem is that the fabric is thin and uncomfortable. I would not wear this bag for long periods of time. I would recommend this bag to anyone. Very nice and comfortable!  Perfect fit for a summer day!I have been wearing these for years.

They are made in India and anything made out of stainless steel in India is usually good. I definitely recommend them. They will last a long time and as per my experience will not rust or deteriorate.
Would give them more stars if they were available."
0,"I don't use these in the woods, but they are good enough to make a difference. I highly recommend them. I am a 32 year old man, so I don't have to worry about wearing them in the woods. I use this as a hiking pack. The first time I used it I was going to park in the woods and it was a little uncomfortable. I was able to pull it off the pack and on my way back to the campsite. I have never used it before, so I will probably never use it again. I have a spare tire, and the strap is a bit loose, but it's great that it is on the pack. The strap does a good job of keeping the pack in place, and I like the quality. I don't have to pull it down with my hands, but I do have to pull it up and keep the top of my head up. I use this to hang a pack of cigarettes and other stuff that I don't want to get in the way of my trip."
0,"These are also sold with a standard 3/4"" thick metal holder that is a little larger than a standard bulb. The plastic holder is also designed to be easily removed from the fixture.

The light is not bright enough to illuminate a room. This is a problem for most people. They need to have a portable light that can be mounted anywhere on the fixture. This is a problem for most people. I installed a 40 watt incandescent bulb at the end of the fixture and it worked great for a few hours. I use this light for about a month now and it is still working great. I would recommend this light to anyone looking for a portable light.This is a great lamp.  I have used it for years and I can tell you that it's a quality product.  I would recommend it.This is a good product.  It's small and compact, but well made.  It's very bright.  I use it to light up a room and it's very good.  I have been using it for several months now and it's always bright.  I'm very pleased with the light and the quality.  I bought two for our house and one for the basement.  The one I received was a little dimmable and the one I received was a little dimmable.  The two I received were pretty much the same.

The adjustable power levels are great too.  However, I would sure appreciate a ""stay on"" button on the next model.

This blender is great for making those quick Whey Protein and fruit shakes!"

1,"I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth."

It was not written in Grisham's usual style, so he's either losing his touch, trying something new, or not paying attention.

We have been using them for a few weeks now and it has lasted for hours!  We love the colors and the size and the size of the rubber bands. They hold up well for a long time.

It was a little pricey for a 5 year old and the only way he could afford it was to buy the wooden pieces instead. He's always been a little more interested in these things, but now that he's a little older it's kind of more of a novelty. He's very happy with it.

1,"A SANDY'S SEASHELL SHOP CHRISTMAS is a novella about a young widow named Tiff Riley and her three and a half year old son, Micah, who spend Christmas on the Outer Banks. Tiff had lost her husband, Aaron, to the war in Afghanistan. She hadn't even had much of a chance to be with him for very long before he was taken away from her. The tragedy of losing her husband and Micah's father at Christmas during the war in Afghanistan was heart-wrenching. She was struggling so badly trying to get through each day. Tiff's grief and disinclination to the prior three Christmases left her feeling empty. Just to be able to make it she ran to the one place she knew her husband loved the best, the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Sandy's sensitivity and perseverance as she drew Tiff and Micah into her Seashell Shop's Christmas party and the impact of the festivities on this family was inspiring.

1,Fabulous series of books. Finished them all as quickly as I could. This story grabs & holds on for dear life. Only suggestion would have been to condense the series from 8 books to 5.

He is the last of the Assassins to come to the rescue of the Templars and the group is led by two Assassins, Deanna and Wilma.

It is one of those can't put it down page Gardner's, haven't read a book so fast in years. I loved her beautiful way with words, her writing is wonderful and so touching. I loved her fierce love of both her Mother Vivian, her Father John & her Stepmother June ring so true. If you're a fan or if you just want to read her lovely gift with language & her journey as a writer, get this book now! For those of you double nickels like me & Rosanne it's a great look back, especially if you're a California Girl too! I haven't lived in So Cal since age 20, but I sure do remember the rattles, scorpions & tarantula's. She is as mindful of her privacy as always, and gracious in her story telling of life through her eyes, an admirable quality. This is not a mean spirited tell all, it's a gift to all who love great writing, her story of telling Johnny her ""New chapter"" she improvised is just so moving. I hope she hurries with her ""more to come"", I can't wait to read more from her!<3"

0,"I purchased this at a discount on Amazon. com. I will update this review if I find a cheaper price. The plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The bulb is not in the same position as the rest of the bulbs. The light is not a very bright white, and it has a very low output (just a single beam). I was hoping that the bulb would be brighter, but it is not. The bulb is not very bright, but I have no doubt that it will last for years, and is still a great value. It is a great value for a good price. This is a very good lamp. I like the fact that it does not have a ""lock"" which means that it can be turned off with the ""lock"" button. I have no idea how to turn it off without this lock, but it does not have the lock button as it is in the picture. I bought a new set and this is the only one I have. I use it to go to the bathroom when I am away from the house. It is a nice lamp that does not turn on when it is dark. It is not the best lamp I have ever owned, but it is perfect. I will buy more of this lamp in the future. This is a good product. I am very happy with the quality of the product. I use it for reading in a dimmer.

0,"Winner of a bevy of national publications, the book is a refreshing glimpse into a period of the past.  The story is told from a very different point of view.  In his first published novel, John Gorman, a young British soldier from the early days of the war, is forced to flee to France to escape the Nazi occupation.  When he is rescued, he is told he is a spy for the Gestapo and is on his way to a Nazi concentration camp.  The story is told from a very different point of view, which is why I recommend it.  The book is a delightful read, and I especially enjoy the characters.  The book is filled with references to other books and to a few other writers.  I can't recommend it enough.  I was very impressed by the writing style of the author.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.

1,"Until Brueggeman's Old Testament Theology was published in 1997, this was  the largest dose one could find in one place. The articles in this  collection were all previously published in journals and other collections,  but tracking them all down would be a difficult task. Therefore, the  volume is very worthwhile. Even in the light of his most recent  publications it is still a useful collection for a couple of other reasons. First, these articles were produced over a period of a couple of decades,  so the attentive reader can observe Brueggeman's biblical theology as it  developed over his career. Second, many of the articles are sustained  treatments of individual texts, the likes of which do not appear in his  recent Old Testament Theology. Most importantly, these essays reveal the  increasing impact of contemporary literary studies on Old Testament  Theology. For all of these reasons this collection is a treasure and may  be considered a prerequisite for reading Brueggeman's ""Old Testament  Theology:  Testimony, Advocacy, and Dispute."

1,"I have no doubt that if I had no life outside of reading, I would've finished this book in a day. With my schedule, it took 4 days, and I truly enjoyed it!  You have to love a book that leaves you smiling as you read the last lines of the book and then sends you to the internet immediately to buy book 2. Charley Davidson is a ""grim reaper"", but not in the traditional sense that we all know. She is a portal through which those who didn't immediately cross over can use to get where they're supposed to go - presumably Heaven. The dead see her as this bright light, which they are usually drawn to, and she sometimes has to help them with their unfinished business before they are ready to cross over. She is also a very witty, sarcastic Private Investigator, and she's very good at it, with the help that she receives from some of the dearly departed. Oh, and there's this supernatural being that comes to her in the night in her dreams and has his way with her, and she's pretty happy about it. While I'm not one who is drawn to those lusty, cliche romance novels, I do love paranormal fiction and suspense, so this book fit the bill. Add to that, Charley's sarcastic sense of humor, which I am all over, and this made for a very quick, enjoyable read. The book is peppered throughout with little sarcastic one-liners, some of which had me laughing out loud and feeling silly, since my family had no idea what was so funny. Some reviewers commented that they were excessive, and maybe so, but not to the point where it might have taken away from my enjoyment of the book. If you have similar tastes, I highly recommend this book. If you're a bit on the prudish side, maybe not so much."

1,"Revised review Dec. 2015:  I finally gave up on these and put them on Ebay!  Impossible boots.  Hard as a rock, NEVER got soft, even after mink oiling, baking, stretching... they were more like torture devices than shoes.  Could not wear them long enough to even begin to break them in, if I walked more than 2 minutes, I got enormous blisters on my heels.  Too much pain for the price!!  A lot of people here seem to love Fryes, but I will never go near a pair again.

--------------

I dithered for months before finally pulling the trigger on these pricey boots.  Can't say I love them...yet.  Well made, but for me the styling is a little off.  The foot is narrow, which isn't bad but I was looking for a ""clunkier"" motorcycle-type boot.  Had them stretched for both length and width.  And the bottom of the sole is very flat and very hard, makes a slapping noise when you walk - !!  Which I personally don't care for.  I guess I was expecting softer rubber with maybe a little tread.  These are almost like riding boots.  Have not even worn them enough to break them in.  Honestly, the $60 Steve Maddens (discontinued, alas!) are more comfortable and more to my liking.  I will come back to these in the fall and see if I can make them work.  Quality-wise, they're great, so no problem there."

As for concealment. These weren't meant to be concealed carry pouches. Nothing with ALICE clips is. They stick out too far."
1,"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings ."

1,"Here's a film where Seagal doesn't just go through those regular paces we all love him for, which is probably why most of the viewers reviewing this film here are disappointed.  I wasn't disappointed at all, and next to Under Siege, this is my favorite Seagal movie.  Not just because of the beautiful scenery, not just because Seagal plays a doctor who cares more about helping his patients get well than he does getting paid, not just because he gives both the government officials and the militia-extremists a real piece of his mind. Not even because of the role that Native American traditions and healing methods play in this film.

Maybe for all those things.  Or maybe because this take-no-prisoners 'tough guy' is a fine role model of a terrific father to his daughter in this film. It's a real treat to see this side of Seagal and it adds a dimension to his character that makes this more than just an action movie.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of enemies to defeat here, and Seagal defeats them all -- including the 'invisible enemy' of biochemical disease.  Not bad, not bad at all.  Better than good in fact.

Five stars."

0,"These are fantastic! They fit perfect on my Glock 17. I also love that they have a full sized inner barrel.  The front sight is also very light and easy to adjust.  The only thing I would change is the size of the scope.  This is a great optic for the money.  I have a 11"" scope on the Springfield XD scope with a telescopic sight.  I would buy these again.  I am very happy with these sights.I love these socks! They are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them everyday for cycling, camping, hiking, and hiking. I am a big fan of these socks. I wear them daily to keep warm, and I like that they keep me from sweating. They also keep my feet warm and dry. I do recommend these socks to anyone. My only complaint is that I have a large head. I am 6'2"" and the size 6 fit my head. I would recommend these socks for anyone.I love this bike seat. It's small and easy to use. I have it mounted on my front end, and it's very comfortable to ride. The seat itself is a bit on the stiff side, but it's not a problem. It's also easy to install and adjust. The seat is a little big for me, but it's a lot of room for storage. I ride a Honda Civic with a seatpost for my bike, and it's a little too large for my bike. It's not a big deal, but I'm not a big fan of the seatpost at all. I think I would have preferred to"

1,"A fun, gay twist on the Cinderella story....a Cinder-FELLA story actually.
I wasn't sure what to expect with a hero living as a woman in his step-mother's home, but I ended up loving Cinder's humor and innocence. From glass slippers to fairy godmothers, evil step-sisters and Prince Charming, all aspects of the classic tale are there, just with a clever twist for the mm romance reader.
When Cinder goes to the ball in a beautiful gown and meets the prince, I was so nervous for him!!
Without giving anything away, Cinder gets his happily ever after....whether or not he's still wearing dresses though I won't say, LOL.
This is a story I will read again when I am in the mood for fun, lighthearted fairy tale."

The first, which is designed to be a more powerful flashlight, is just as powerful as the one I replaced. The second is a compact, high-powered, and a bit smaller than the one I replaced. The combination of these features makes this flashlight a great value for the money. I am not sure if I will ever buy another one. I have had no problems with the flashlight. I will update this review as I receive more information. Thanks!Good quality, great price. Seems like a great product. I bought these to replace my old garage door opener with this one.

1,"One finds out pretty clearly and directly who the murderer is about midway through the book.  At that point then, since there's a lot of book left, the plot must follow the police closing in on the killer and an exciting finish.  That requires attention to pacing with matters picking up and slowing down.  That's what made Da Vinci Code such a good read as well Le Carre' novels like Tinker, Tailor.... That's what's absent from elevating this book above the pack. Otherwise, it's not awful, it's just no better or worse than the other tripe out there that serves as a backdrop permitting us to identify better work.  And distasteful, as well as not credible, bits like Kate's having her coffee handground by an ancient Chinese woman (must be about 150 years old she opines) on an ancient handgrinder (or perhaps it's driven by a waterwheel) that she opines must be about 250 years old. Oh daahling, ratherrr!  Puh-leeze!

Actions speak louder than words so my action on the murderer being revealed midway though and then the plodding pace the plot then takes was to skip to the end to see if perhaps there was some twist inserted in the interim pages that resulted in someone else being the murderer. Nope. Instead, through an incredible plot device, the murderer instead comes to them and is about to shoot them when someone dives forward, windowglass shatters as simultaneously others enter the room and the murderer is off balance when the gun goes off.  Hmm, never heard of that happening in a mystery before.  What makes that device work is when the pacing just carries you along, otherwise it's a yawner at the end."

A special female was raised to give birth to the next werewolf boy. Valentine Lo Bo is wealthy last werewolf, thousands of tears old. Mirella was the special female.

1,"I'm a plus size woman (24/26 in pants, 3X in shirts), but only C cup breasts. It's hard to find lingerie that fits the way I want. I'm not one of those comfortable big girls that likes flaunting it or wearing lots of tight things so I definitely wanted something loose. I spent 4 hours browsing multiple sites for plus size lingerie and read every review I could find. I ended up buying this in a 5X because the reviews were mostly consistent with buying 2 sizes up. I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal. Theres a lot of material to cover more, but it's tight enough to not be useless on smaller cup sizes. It's obviously not great material, but for this price, you shouldn't expect too much. I would recommend it overall."

I ordered these to put them in my camper as ambiance lighting under the edge of the bed and couches and boy are they much more! I am going to be putting these around the slide out edges and more. Have to order more. I love you can cut them to length you want.

I figured they would be fair to moderately bright and maybe be able to be changed from white to colors. I had no idea that they were programmable, had presets you can make, the controls are more than robust, they are amazing! As you can see in the video and photos these things can be made to shine brighter or dimmer, and any color combination you can think of or of course the solid colors of Red, Yellow, Green, and Blue. The ability to change the settings are endless and was fun to play with.
What I like is these are bright enough to be used to illuminate a work bench or a working area, and also as decorative lighting like I am going to use them for.
These LED lights are more than I had hoped for and are amazing for the price. They are on a strip which you can cut to length and is adhesive backed. I will be using some extra strength double sided tape to help hold it in place.

If you need LED strip lighting for indoor use, this is definitely something you can use and able to do more than people think! My son wants some now for his room to put up. As you can see from the last photo I decided to install them in my new office. I used the adhesive backing on the strip and it stuck no problem. I cut to the length of the space I had and it worked fantastic! I get a lot of compliments."

After renting the movie, I automatically signed on and logged onto Amazon to see if it was available  on the ""open market.""  This has to be one of the most  inspirational, uplifting, eye-opening movies I have observed in a very long  time.  I had limited movement due to my cat being asleep on me so the one  paper towel I did have became very wet in a short amount of time.  If you  want to see children light up and the professional community come together  for a good cause, this is the movie for you.

1,"Like most folks, I'd like to spend as little money as possible to complete my projects. Skimping here was not a great idea, however. If you're not aware of what a proper connector should look like, or if durability is not a concern, then this certainly looks like a great deal. It's half the price of a quality part. And I've returned mine, because I'm not willing to save money at the expense of significant quality reduction. Yes these look like the connector you want. But don't be fooled. They're the Playskool version of the real thing. Great for display or demonstrations, but I won't use them to pass 30A of 230V.

I never thought I'd become a ""connector snob"" but here I am. The high quality Leviton units are well worth the extra money, because their quality IS that much better."

1,"You're at a party.  Or maybe you're at a work event.  And somebody spends the night trying to convince you of who they are.  They're trying to convince you that they are honest or highly creative or a really, really involved parent.  To paraphrase the bard, ""I think thou tries to prove themselves too much.""  Whenever someone tries hard to sell themselves, to sell you on a notion of who they are, they are almost always never that person.  That's all you can take away from one of those ambushes with any certainty.  Why do I bring it up?

This book is the exact opposite experience.  Brett is never trying to convince you of anything.  Story after story, she is nothing but humble and candid.  It's really what elevates the book.  It never reads too preachy and she never claims to know anymore than what her experiences have brought her.  And, so many of her lessons come from those she has watched and studied over the years.  Her time spent as a reporter works so nicely in this book.  She is in every story, but never demands the attention or the spotlight.  And, she never once tries to turn this into an ""issues"" book.  She mentions her own terribly troubled past only when necessary and only in the increments needed to move the story along.  This, I think, allows her own quiet yet clear voice to shine throughout.  Simple, yet elegant.  She must be one heck of a lady.  She never tries to convince me of it, but it's what I walk away with.  Nice, nice piece of writing.

Aaron is completely sweet and well a wish fulfillment hero for someone as hurt and angry as Zack. Zack's voice in wonderful with great asides to the read and wry self reflection.

Aaron is a bit of a doormat but there is some nice conflict around making sure Zach and Aaron are partners in this relationship.

As much as I liked it, and I did, there are issues with the writing in terms of unresolved stuff,.

Aaron's relationship with Zach's brother and wife need to be discussed. There is so much co dependency in Aaron.

Zach needs therapy for his childhood trauma.

The plot pacing is sluggish so while even though I enjoyed it, others will be driven batty.
Aaron has no pets. He is a vet. We never get to see his love of animals.

When it arrived I was so excited.  It looks very sleek, modern and yet classic so it would fit right in with any kitchen decor.  Once, the rest of the family saw it everyone wanted to measure 'stuff' to see how it worked.  Besides the refrigerator it is now our most used appliance in our kitchen.  My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc for the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces or grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons. This scale makes it a breeze to make any recipe.  I highly recommend you try this scale out, we have had it for nearly a month and just love it!"

I am not sure if I will be able to wear these again for a couple of weeks, but I am very pleased with these shoes.

However, the toe bed does have a little extra room for your feet.  This is not to mention the fact that the color is lighter than I thought.

1,"Wallace Thurman was an influential figure in the Harlem Renaissance, the era of heightened creativity in writing, art and music that arose in Harlem following World War I. In Thurman's short life he wrote novels, plays, poems and essays and started two magazines. A bohemian who drank and partied hard, he died at age thirty-two of tuberculosis.

The Blacker the Berry, first published in 1929, gives a fascinating picture of Harlem in the 1920s with its vibrant street life, easy sex, wild house-rent parties and black cabarets frequented by thrill-seeking whites.

The story follows the many tribulations of young Emma Lou Morgan. The tragedy of her life is not being black, but too black. Her light-skinned mother is ashamed of her dark-skinned daughter.

An alien in her own family, Emma Lou is universally snubbed in her hometown of Boise, Idaho, where high browns and half whites rule Negro society. Even at college in Los Angeles, the colored sorority won't have her. Harlem is her last chance to find a haven from the color snobbery within her own race.

Emma Lou, however, brings her troubles with her wherever she goes, for she too is a color snob. She'll fall for a light-colored good-for-nothing over an intelligent black man every time. Emma Lou's experiences make painful reading at times, but eventually open her eyes and give her new hope.

Wallace Thurman was an acute social critic, and his satirical talent is full strength in The Blacker the Berry."

I understand this was a ""short"" story,  but it felt off gleaning essential (and nonessential) character quirks and even general information solely from the summary. Some of this added to the story, even explained a character's motivation to do or not do something, and a lot of this information wasn't to be found within the pages of the book.

1,"Described as wittily funny and utterly brilliant I found it neither, though it was intriguing, so I stayed with it. The economy has tanked in the U. S. and anarchy is just beginning to bare its ugly teeth. Stan and Charmaine are without jobs or house (they lost it when they could no longer make the payments), and they're living in their car, moving constantly to avoid roaming gangs and sleeping only in snatches. Charmaine does work a few hours in a dive bar; her best friends now are prostitutes who service their customers in the back room. So when Charmaine sees an ad on TV for the Positron Project in the town of Consilience the couples decides they have nothing to lose. They board a bus for the complimentary trip, they're wined and dined and put up in a nice hotelhot showers! fresh bedsheets! wine with dinner! Not everyone gets in, mind you, and Stan and Charmaine go through a series of workshops meant to weed out the undesirables. If they make it, a house in the cute little 50s-era town of Consilience is theirs. The catch? They spend 30 days in the Positron Prison and 30 days as townspeople for the rest of their lives. Because theres no leaving the Project once you sign on the dotted line. The towns motto? Do time now, buy time for our future. Cons + Resilience = Consilience. Yikes. The rest of the novel is a whirl of selective euthanasia and sex robots and Elvis impersonators and an attempted escape to Las Vegas, of all places! That, and some sort of sex imprinting brain surgery that backfires occasionally, leaving one woman with a fetish for a blue knit teddy bear. The Heart Goes Last is a little bit Truman Show, with a pinch of Stepford Wives and 1984, perhaps. (Heres Atwood talking about the novel on NPR)

Originally written as a serial for the online publisher Byliner, the novel was entertainingbut The Heart Goes Last was no Handmaids Tale. [read more at thisismysymphony."

The only Rush Shows I've seen lately have been at Red Rocks, so Snakes and Arrows twice and Time Machine twice. If you're a Rush fan and you haven't heard the audience recordings of the Time Machine shows at Red Rocks, you're missing out on some treats. I've read the critical comments by other reviewers here and I see it differently. Great performance, great A/V. Is it like a studio recording? Of course not! Rush has processes they use when writing that can give a certain snap-shot view of a song that very well might have progressed by the time it gets to your local venue. During the Time Machine tour, you could hear it by listening to Caravan from the studio with what it had become by the time they reached Denver. It was alive! You simply have to see Rush live - and often. People have been reported to behave inappropriately if deprived of their Rush fix. Get this and laugh a little, smile a lot. It's an awesome set."

1,"This is only the second dystopian novel I've read so I don't have much to compare it to in this genre. What I do know is that I thoroughly enjoyed following the story of Raine, Jem and Leif. While there are a few lighthearted, even romantic aspects, there also many dark, heartbreaking moments and more than a few surprises. While I am by nature a voracious reader, I will admit to the habit of skipping sections of books when the story drags even a little. I did not skip sections in this book, and while a few other readers commented on a slow beginning, personally I did not find that to be the case. Clearly the story ends on a note meant to set the reader up for the next book in the series. This can be tricky because the author needs to leave the reader feeling satisfied with where they've ended this part of the story, and yet wanting more.

1,"Love love love love love! Honestly, it's rare that I read a split time book and like both the historical and contemporary storylines equally. usually I end up loving the historical story so much more. But this time, I'm so happy to say I adored both! And the way both storylines are woven together near the end. ahhhh, so good. Love the writing, love the characters. Birdie, especially! And I can't help loving the way Tenley's storyline so perfectly captured the not-so-glittery side of being a writer."

1,"I hadn't used a strop before and decided to see what this could do on my fixed blade knives.  I was really surprised.  You can take a knife that's sort of sharp and get it to the next level with this strop.  I just wouldn't have predicted it.  So in terms of performance, I'd rate this at least a 4 star, maybe 5.  Why only 3 stars?  This is WAY overpriced.  You can get double sided, quality strops for about $20 and the green compound is like $5 for a huge block of the stuff.  Yes it takes some effort to ""load"" the leather, but if you look on youtube you'll find all kinds of tricks to make that work.  This strop should cost about $25.  Didn't realize that at the time I bought it.  So, nice effective strop, but way too expensive."
0,"So, I never even got a chance to test it. I will say that my cats are pretty picky about their food and I am not going to waste any money on a food that is not 100% safe.

If you're thinking about going with this food, you should definitely read the reviews.

Also, I'm not sure if it is a product of the cats or just their natural diet. Maybe the cat is on a diet with a protein, so if that's your cat's diet, I would definitely recommend it.

I also recommend this food to my friends, and especially my friends that are older cats. I can't say enough about how they love this food. I got a huge ""thank you"" for the food and I am so thankful for that.I love this product.  I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not on any of these.

Just the three in the band with occasional kids here and there--very boring sets, etc. I'd recommend skipping the video and just buying the music cd (this one also came with a music cd, so that is a nice bonus). If you want fun videos, buy a DVD collection of Jacks' Big Music Show."

1,"I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"

1,"Took it shooting yesterday. Only took 6 rds to get it dialed in at 50 yards right out of the box!! The clarity outside in actual use was far better than what I thought while looking through it inside my house at night, from 3x all through 12x. The side parallax adjustment is great as well. I was able to ring steel at 200 with boring regularity, and it didn't seem to lose zero after 100 rounds of .308. Only complaint is that there is a little bit of distortion and the edges of the filed of view, but it's only noticeable if you intentionally look at the edges.

The illuminated reticle uses a light that washes all over the inside of the scope, not just on the crosshairs, so that is a bit of an annoyance, but I don't forsee myself using the illuminated reticle. Just putting that out for those that will.

The rings that come with the scope appear to be of phenomenal quality, every bit as good as the Warne rings I purchased for another rifle. There are 4 screws per ring that tighten around the tube, which I feel provides a far more secure mount.

I wish the rings positioned it a hair higher, but overall I am extremely pleased with the performance of the scope. Even more so considering for my $113 delivered to my door, I got a set of rings that seem every bit as good as the last 30mm rings I got from Warne for another AR.

I would say this would make a great scope for someone looking for a decent scope on a budget, especially considering it's a 30mm tube!!"

1,"I enjoyed Mankind's book, so I bought this one.  This one was quite different.  It had a ghost-writer, which is an immediate red flag.  It's quite evident too, since some of the happenings in the book are out of sequence.

The way the Rock talks about losing his virginity at an early age, he makes it sound like it's almost a good thing.  Man, don't promote sexual activity to young kids.

I haven't read a wrestling autobiography since this disappointment.  My advice is this, don't buy this book, don't buy Chyna's book, don't buy Lita's book.  Buy Mick Foley's book if you must read about the life of a wrestler."

1,"LOVE THIS COVER!! The quality is excellent and I love that it covers not only the back seat, but also the sides of the back seat, the floor, and the backs of the front seats. Before I got this cover, I had old blankets trying to protect my leather seats from 2 large labs!  And any other covers I purchased didn't fit well and ended up useless.  It has great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even less if you are in a rush and you skip some of the steps that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fittings that attach it around headrests (rear seats and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fittings that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the sides of the vehicle as well as between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it does not slide around too much. It fits well in my Lexus ES350.  This does the trick of protecting the leather from their nails.  I especially like the generous flap that connects to the front seats and then hangs down to the floor to keep their hair contained, instead of flying all over.  I ordered the grey even thought my interior is tan.  I couldn't tell if I would like the tan shown in the pictures and I also have grey in other areas of my car so it blends well.  It was very easy to install but haven't figured out how to get the back of it to stay in place better but I feel like there is a way with a little help from my husband.  The main function is to keep the seat protected from their nails since I have the perforated leather that can easily be torn. I would definitely recommend!  I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion."

The last film is the last of the four in the series, and it's the last of the four in the series.  The only change is the addition of a new character, a man who lives in the past and is now a new person.

1,"You can make plans and decide what your path in life will be.  That is all well and good, but... sometimes life has other plans for you and no matter how stubborn you are about staying in the path you have chosen, you will need to adapt and accept that nothing in life is perfect.  It is out of those imperfections, or deviations if you will, that life presents us with challenges and triumphs we may have otherwise missed.

Our story follows Sophie as she is about to achieve her life-long desire to become a teacher. She has done everything in her power to put herself through college while supporting her brother and her wheelchair-bound father.  It has taken incredible determination and self-control to achieve this.

When William comes into her life, she recognizes there is something special between them.  Letting this unique attraction grow is both scary and invigorating.  How they recognize this feeling is mutual and growing is the constant undercurrent to our story.

In the end, we walk away knowing life is full of challenges.  A well-planned future has to be adjustable.  We must bend to the unexpected trials we find along our way to our future.  Love is the constant and family sustains us."

His hot older brother Paul is Suze's age, and he keeps pestering Suze into going out with him. Of course, she doesnt want to because she is falling in love with Jesse, even though he is dead and they can't be together. At home her step dad and step brother are digging in the back yard to install a hot tub. During the night, another ghost yet again, wakes her up. This time it's not a ghost seeking her help, it's a ghost threatening that the digging stop or she'll kill Suze. This ghost was Jesse's fiance, who he was on his way to marry when he died, and Suze believes she knows why this ghost wants the digging to end. To find out what happens read it!

1,"I am a horror genre junkie, and whereas I really loved The Blair Witch Project, I really disliked this. I walked away from the theater, which had 6 other people in it, going seriously, I paid for this?? Even my 19 year old son wasn't impressed and he scares easily. I kept waiting for the feeling of fear to hit me and it never did. I looked at my phone to check the time and it was an hour in already and nothing fantastic had happened yet.

My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirits and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away.

I watch shows like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back. My husband wanted to see it and I told him he'd be better off to wait for it to hit DVD and watch it then. If you haven't seen it, rent the movie before you buy it."
1,The fit and feel of the top are fine but it's see through so I won't be wearing it. I hate bras and this shirt needs a strapless bra. I got the Yellow color so maybe if you get a different color it will be wearable.

1,"I love PattyBoutik but I am on the fence on this one. I usually wear a S or M in most brands of shirts and for this shirt the small for this top fit perfect on me. I am 5'3"" at around 145lbs. I wanted something to cover my tummy area, but I'm torn because on one hand it fits great but on the other I worry it's too puffy looking in the front. My biggest fear though is with this color that sweat will easily show so I haven't worn it to photograph any hot weather weddings, which is why I bought it. The other thing is I feel like I need to tan with this color. It blends in with my skin tone so much that it looks nude on me and I'm so pail that I wish I got a different color. So all in all I may just wear this one around the house. BUT that has nothing to do with the product itself!  This fabric of this shirt feels so soft on the skin and washes nicely. I got it right away, shipping is fast and reliable. Wrapped up nicely makes you feel like it's a present! :) Will be buying more in the future regardless and other styles. Thank you once again for a great style PattyB!"

1,"The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.

The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scenes was a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This was not good vs evil, it was just two people who happened to be on two different sides of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII.

My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapters are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax. Personally, I found that climax to be a bit anti-climactic. But overall, that detracted very little from my enjoyment of the novel and would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, WWII, or well-written literature."

1,"3.5 torn stars, rounded up. I liked the story, but it was a cliffhanger, which I really don't like at all. When I invest hours of precious time in a story, get into it, and then discover I have to buy the next ""x"" number of books to find out what happens and get some closure, I'm not happy.

Besides that, I did like the story. I'm a big fan of paranormal romance, and this one was different enough from the usual to be fresh and interesting. After a slow start detailing the travels of the heroine, things really picked up when she finally found what she'd been looking for all along - a vampire. The characters were likable enough, though some plot lines seemed a little forced. Paranormal secondary characters were enjoyable, but I found the heroine's best friend to be pushy and kind of obnoxious.

I'm not sure if I'll grab the next one, knowing I'm setting myself up for another cliffhanger (did I mention I really don't like cliffhangers?). It will depend on if the story sticks with me in the next couple of weeks."

The screen is about twice as bright as the 300, about 1/3 the weight. The battery lasts about half of the 300s but as long as you can use the cigerette lighter thats not a problem. The speaker is surprisingly loud (louder than Garmin Nuvi 660, Magellan 3410 among others). The window mount is built very cheaply but you don't need a lot of strength as the ONE is very light. The features are light on this unit, no text to speech, bluetooth,etc but for what you need this is a terrific GPS. The touchscreen is very responsive compared to the Magellan. You can't beat this deal."

1,"This is really a beautiful set of high quality knives that I anticipate lasting a long time.  The come from the factory razor sharp and over the limited time I have used them have show no signs of wear.  The set features a nice variety of knives from a small paring knife all the way up to a good size butcher's knife.  All feature excellent balance and enough weight to feel serious and comfortable without being clumsy.  Moreover, the handles are nicely positioned relative to the blade, which makes chopping both easier and safer.  I will say that in particular I liked the serrated carving knife, something you don't typically see in this size set.  I happened to be cooking a roast the day the knives arrived, and the carving knife made short, clean work of it.

It would be nice if there was an option to receive a block instead of a magnet rack; I'm not opposed to the latter, but I don't happen to have a convenient place to hang it which is going to make storing these knives a small, but worthwhile challenge.  In short I would say that these are high quality knives, and for the price point, a solid investment."

From the very first chapters, it was apparent that the author had a gift for storytelling.  He was able to assemble the story, the facts, the characters and the energy in a way that leaves the reader begging for more.

Each chapter dramatically reveals new information, only to end with new questions arising.  As a result, I found it impossible to find a good spot to stop reading.  Five hours later, I finished the book, completely sated and thrilled that this book found its way into my hands."

Think about it, if you carry with a round in the chamber ( you're an idiot if you dont) and you stick a gun down your pants, what is covering your trigger? Nothing. No one plans on having negligent discharges but they happen. Number 1 cause--- clothing gets in the way when drawing/ holstering the gun. What if you get in a fist fight and have to roll around on the ground? It wouldn't be hard for your shirt to get wrapped up in your trigger and go off.

He can be soft and seem predictable until you turn to the next few pages and hard core horror jumps out at you from no where. After reading many of his novels that has kept me trembling in horror through many a night, Luther Kite series come to mind with many others. Ok, as true horror fan, maybe I am a bit delightfully scarred from reading them. Snowbound is one of his softer sides in no way disappointing never-the-less.

1,"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time."

1,"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

1,"Update 9/12/2013:
This shirt has been the best i've worn so far - it makes me feel cooler more comfortable on the trail runs.
Please note size chart below; the information was provided by Saucony and it seems Runners like to feel larger than they actually are compared to the rest of the population; therefore, saucony's sizes will run smaller than most manufacturers sizes.

The shirt performs very well and the only problem I have is the fit - My chest size is 48 and most XL's fit nicely,, however, this XL might be maxed out to 45 or 46.
Great Shirt - poor fit for larger chest sizes.

Saucony's Size Chart for men:

Chest size:
Small:  36-38
Medium:  39-40
Large:  41-43
XLarge:  44-46

1,If I could give this 0 stars I would. We have 2 cats and 2 litter pans making us have to change the litter once a week. This stuff clumps and is ultra fine making it nearly impossible to scoop because half the pan becomes like solid clay when liquid is introduced and the litter gets everywhere. We now have to change the litter about every 2-3 days. I will never recommend this garbage to anyone and will never buy it again. With how many good reviews and buys this had I was really excited but all we got was a tiny bag and complete disappointment. If you have more things to do with your life rather than changing litter every waking hour of the day this litter isn't for you. I wouldn't even spit in the general direction of this crap.

0,"1984 by George Orwell is a novel, with a distinctively dystopian plot that makes the reader feel as if they are the protagonists. The characters are complex, and the plots are very interesting.

The novel is in many ways a reflection of the American political scene. Its almost eerie, and a bit depressing at times, and it is a great way to introduce a new generation of readers to the subject matter of dystopian literature. But the novel is also an interesting introduction to a new generation of readers to dystopian literature. The novel is a fun, quirky read, with plenty of twists and turns.

In short, it is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read.

1,"These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family."

1,"We just got our first puppy about a month ago and did not realize how hard potty training would be. We live in an apartment and our puppy could not ""hold"" during his hourly trips to the elevator and outside, so we had to resort to an indoor potty. We first tried the scented pads- our pup would just play and shred them to pieces. We had a fake grass which worked well but it smelled really bad, clean up was a hassle and he was eating plastic bits. So when we came across DoggieLawn on Amazon, we decided to give it a try- at least he'll be eating real grass. It came on schedule in a prepackaged box, all you have to do is take off the lid, the grass was so green! Our puppy did his business on the grass immediately, but for the first few days there was a lot of grass eating and lounging on the pad.  You would need to supervise and make sure the dog is using it correctly. The best part is, there was no odor and no clean up! The urine gets absorbed in the grass pad and doesn't leak through the paper box. (we don't let him do #2 on the doggielawn). Also it's low maintenance- just spray with water a few times a week. We've had our doggielawn grass for a month now and it's time to change- it's turned brown and the odor is accumulating but it lasted longer than the 2 week period recommended by the company. Our pup has learned to go potty (#1) every time we put him on the grass. The downside is he was able to dig a small hole in the grass, however there's an option of getting an anti-dig mat which he haven't tried. Also, it is a bit expensive: $29 per one grass pad or a $50/month subscription for 2 pads. We'll keep getting these until he's fully potty trained!

We have a 10lb puppy and the standard size is perfect- there's enough room for him to circle and sniff."

1,This was an excellent movie from start to finish. The story and the dialogue were constantly engaging. Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all. The costumes and makeup were so good I did not recognize several actors at first. I did not care for the ending but it fit the story and any other ending would have felt contrived. I came here to buy a copy because this was one of the best movies I have seen in years.

1,"What can I say about this film that hasn't already been said?

I wasn't particularly interested in ""Office Space"" when it first came out, and I assume that it was a sleeper hit upon theatrical release, but when I checked it out much later, I was on the floor laughing. Not only does ""Office Space"" stand out as a great comedy for those starved of great comedy, but manages to hit closer with those actually victimized by white-collar occupations. It's suprising how this evolved from a series of cheaply-made animated shorts, starring the squirrely stapler-obsessed Milton, and into an underestimated masterpiece.

Some would say that a comedy doesn't really require top-notch acting to get its hilarity across, but ""Office Space"" is a grand exception. Ron Livingston is perfect in the role of Peter, who learns that by doing nothing you can find the ultimate happiness and confidence you seek (thanks to unreversed hypnosis). Gary Cole's portrayal of the boring yet frightening Lumbergh should be added to the pantheon of best screen villains ever, and Stephen Root was simply born to play Milton.

Mike Judge obviously felt compelled to split open the unexplored injustice of white-collar slavery and definitely makes it work. This isn't a gross-out comedy full of outrageous behavior (I don't know if the bludgeoning of the copy machine counts), but if you want to unwind after a tough day of school or work and enjoy a downright funny-as-hell movie, you're making the right decision to owe this one a few bucks."

0,"Nice heavy duty collar for a puppy and the materials are good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is very heavy, and the cover is very flimsy.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.This is a great product. The reviews said it was a great product, but it's not. I ordered it to use as a collar for my dog who had a sensitive stomach. I'm not sure what it is about it, but it's definitely not a collar for the dog. I've never been able to find a collar for a dog with sensitive stomachs. I have used this for a couple of years now and it's working very well.I'm a huge fan of this product and I've used it for years. My cat was obsessed with it and the cat loves it! I'm happy to say that this is not only a very well made product, but I will definitely recommend this product to anyone.My dog loves this toy and the only thing I don't like is that it's made of cardboard and it's very hard to assemble. It's hard to put together and it's not easy to pick up and store in the car. I would recommend this toy for anyone who has a dog who has trouble getting it together.Love the fact that it's made of plastic and feels very sturdy. This thing is pretty durable.

1,"It did not work for the 2 cats I bought it for, didn't seems to effect them at all."
1,"This is a perfect example of CGI taking over.  It's obvious someone drew up a storyboard with a dozen action scenes and another dozen tense lines.  There may have been vague intentions to add in credible plot details and character motivations before the actors arrived.  Time apparently ran out.  This Lex Luthor is the weakest villain of all time...just incredibly bland and flat.  The actors are given so little to work with that scenes must be propelled with clenched teeth, furrowed brows, and pained brooding.  None of them seem like they could have possibly had a minute of fun in their whole lives.  The color palette is dreary and limited.  The musical cues are mind numbingly predictable.  The camera angles are never inventive.  Except for a couple of new visuals, it's so much of the same old same old.  That's unforgiveable considering how many actors have now played Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent.  If either of them show up in some other form or fashion I would beg Hollywood to stop any and all references to their past.  It's becoming a xerox of a xerox."

1,"I own a 2005 Cadillac CTS with a Bose system. If I were Bose, I would be ashamed to put my name on it as the factory speakers suck so badly. I replaced the sub with a Kicker and amp and the front door speakers with a pair of Infinity reference 6032cf's I got from Amazon. I went with these as they are 2 ohm just as the system speakers are.

These speakers are incredible! With the sub dialed in to my base level preference the sound system now sounds like it should have with the name BOSE on it.

These speakers are not meant to be a replacement base speaker, however they do an admirable job with it. The two position (0db - 3db)tweeter is phenomenal and the mids are so clear! Since I'm not trying to explode my kidneys or rock the car next to me with too much volume, I am more than pleased with Infinity.

A word of caution here... the Infinity site says that the rear door speakers for the first generation CTS are 6.5""... Do NOT believe it. the rears are 5.25""... I had to return one set 6.5's and I'm waiting for the 5.25's to arrive so I can finish the install.

Amazingly good speakers for the price and Amazon's free freight and fast delivery are great as well."
1,"Needed hangers in a pinch and this was the best deal I found without going out to a discount retailer where you could pick up the same amount for a couple bucks less, but usually they're a bit more flimsy.

These are surprisingly strong for the cost. Certainly not indestructible but I'm not worried about them breaking anytime soon. They hold my suit pants, some suit jackets, dress shirts, etc. without issue.

Will buy again once I need more."

1,"Update (8/2/2014):
It has been two years and the switch is still working great.

Update:
I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.
By the way don't bother calling the ""technical service number"", they can only tell you to send the product into their warranty center.  Write them an email at info@leviton.com

old review:
Bought this switch from the local home improvement store.  The switch stopped working reliably after about 1 week.  You have to switch it back and forth and press down on it hard to get the light to stay on.  The GFCI outlet seems to work fine."

1,"I download a lot of books but rarely read them all the way through.  This was different -- I enjoyed learning more about the gaming world, there was romance and a good plot, and enough sex for those who want it.  It was very much Fifty Shades of Grey in the gaming world, and parts were a little like Pretty Woman, but both with a more independent and intelligent heroine.  The only distractions were that the entire book needs an editor to proofread it, and maybe a little too much detail about what the main characters were wearing.  Oh, and the techie terms and name pronunciations should have been up front or referenced at the beginning.  Looking forward to reading more from this author!"

Andy Rooney started out as a reporter on a B-17 aircraft and takes you through a mission that he experienced. It shows you the tragedy of planes not returning and young men coming back from the battle dead or wounded. It also includes interviews of several veterans of the air war. When I watch this film, I try to visualize what it was like to be shot down in a B-17, then captured and put into a NAZI's prison camp as my uncle was! Would I have found the strength to endure?"

1,"Good start for an author. I'm not sure if this is the author's first book or not, but it read like a beginner. Still, no obvious grammatical errors and every consistent writing (as far as tone and flow). The story could be deeper (read very plain), and the dialogue needs to be smoother; less forced, less formal. The sentences felt choppy and a bit elementary. Needed emotion because it felt very one dimensional.  I didn't find myself falling into the story as I would of a veteran writer, but very good start. I don't regret reading this one, but I won't go recommending it necessarily. I hope this author keeps writing because she'll only get better. Lots of potential."

1,"This was a fun, clever book. I was leery of an indie title, but this one was better written/edited than many. This book gives you the perspective of a group of people playing a dungeons-and-dragons-type game, as well as the characters in the game (the NPCs, or non-player-characters). I'll admit as I was reading the book, I at first thought he spent too much time in the characters and I wanted him to ""pull back out"" to show the people playing the game; but in hindsight, he balanced it just right. He wrote it in such a way that keeps the reader guessing to figure out which characters are truly NPCs and which ones are being ""played"" by the people in the real world. The characters were all well-developed. The writing style was simple and easy to read, sometimes feeling much like a D&D module, but adding in enough of the feelings and motivations of the characters to make them feel more real. I would recommend this book, especially to those who have ever played D&D."

0,"This watch is my second pair of the same watch. I will keep this one in my collection.I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area.  He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which was perfect for him.  He wears a size 7 and a size 8.  I ordered a size 11 and the fit is perfect.  He will be wearing this watch all winter long.  The only negative I have is that it is very cheap material.  I am hoping the price will be higher, since he is a size 7.  Otherwise, it's a great watch.  The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot wear it with jeans.  However, it is not thin and thin enough to cover his entire body.  It is light, but very cool.  I have a size 8 and ordered a size 10.  I am hoping the price will go up a bit, since the band is a bit small and the band is a bit short.

There are a lot of small pieces that can easily be moved around in the boat. If you're looking for something that can be put together in about 20 minutes, it's a great option. If you're looking for something that is just for a little child, this is an excellent option.Great product, very durable.My son loves this toy. The kids were excited about it, but it was a bit difficult to use and needed more help from the adults. A couple of the things that I found to be disappointing was that the directions were hard to follow. It seems like you have to follow a different set of instructions than what you have to follow. My son is almost 3 and he doesn't know how to operate the motor yet. I would have liked to have gotten a better instructions, but I just don't see how that would have helped.

The price was good and it's a great product. The price is great and it's a great toy. The size is perfect for the size of a small child. The colors are vibrant and bright. The material is soft and durable"
1,"I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in"

I was a bit skeptical that this little device would work, but it works perfectly.  You just open it up, program the pins, and it's good to go. I've only tested the range from ~ 2 car lengths (b/c that's all I need) but from that range it works flawlessly.

I am using it with the TRS-10 and it's just a matter of removing the hinge and tightening it. If it was to break off after a few weeks, it could break the hinge and break the screw. So it's a little tricky to get it to work. I tried to do it by putting a piece of tape on the bottom of the hinge to make sure it wouldn't fall out, but it did not. I'm a little concerned about it being a good hinge, because it's only about 10 feet away from the hinge, but it's definitely a good hinge."

1,"The Sweetest Taboo by author Harper Miller, is a stunning debut BDSM novel depicting a BWWM D/s interracial romance. Rick and micah's relationship is neither unrealistic to the lifestyle, nor is it unrealistic to a fairytale or whirlwind romance you might hear about over brunch with your friends  and author Harper Miller's deft turn with the pin (mesmeric, though?) is certainly a refreshing addition to the IR/MC genre. Specifically, I really appreciate the intense amount of effort that went into both the packaging as well as the research  the cover is stunning (I want to be micah, and I want to be with Rick) and the very skillful editing. No spoilers here, but I hope that this author has an extremely bright future, and I look forward to reading many, many more of her books. Great craft!

1,"I've really enjoyed this series and feel this book is the best so far. Relationship issues between the main characters (Ivy, Rachel, Jenks, etc. ) are becoming more complex and less confusing. The author has really hit her stride in bringing all of these characters to life. The plot was fast-paced, resulting in me staying up way too late to finish it. Although the main character, Rachel, is getting stronger, she still has flaws and makes mistakes - keeping her real. The only (mild) criticism that comes to mind is the continued Ivy/Rachel angst. It hasn't hit overload yet, but I fear it might if it continues throughout the series. Overall, this was a great 5-star read for me."

1,"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

Of course, it helps that I love Bob."

The other two cameras I've tried, both have excellent sound and are easily adjustable.

The only downside is the battery life, which is about the same as an average DSLR.

I'm not a pro photographer and I'm not sure if it would be worth it to take a lot of shots with it, but it is nice to have an external camera, so I don't have to worry about losing the battery.

The only downside is that the battery life is a little short, but it is still usable.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the camera and recommend it to anyone looking to get professional DSLR photography.

1,"Having read and thoroughly enjoying Bernstein's earlier biography of Thomas Jefferson, I decided to give THOMAS JEFFERSON: THE REVOLUTION OF IDEAS, a look. Like his earlier work, this is a wonderful introduction to Jefferson, however this book is geared towards the school age reader. Much of the text is identical to the earlier biography. The most significant difference is the addition of dozens of illustrations, from portraits of Jefferson's friends, family, and foes, and political cartoons. My single knock on Bernstein's book is the same knock I had on his previous work. Bernstein adamantly portrays Jefferson as a ""strict separationist"", which in and of itself is accurate. However he fails to recognize that what constituted a ""strict separationist"" 200 years ago is much different than the definition given in today's climate of political correctness gone awry. Bernstein seems genuinely perplexed that Jefferson ""sent Christian missionaries to establish schools in western territories to educate Native Americans - and convert them to Christianity. "" As with extremists today, Bernstein fails to understand that Jefferson's actions did not violate the First Amendment in that ""Congress made no law respecting the establishment of religion. ""

I could spend all day writing about how mixed up people are about what the First Amendment means and how it was intended by our framers, but that strays from the subject at hand. All in all, this is a great introduction for school children and should capture their interest and perhaps, lead them into more indepth study of one of our greatest leaders. Monty Rainey

1,"UPDATE: I believe this vacuum is now going on 4 years old and still works like a champ. Had to replace the filter twice in that timeframe, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Probably go on for another 4 years.

I'll keep it short:

No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.  We did a side by side comparison of another upright vacuum, and this pulled more dirt and more pet hair out of the carpet than the other one.  Not by a little bit, but by a huge amount.  I vacuumed the house before sending the other vacuum back.  Then immediately vacuumed the house again: it looked as though I never vacuumed it with the other vacuum; the lint bucket was full.

1,"I loved this book! I adore Julia Quinn's writing style and, while they do tend to get a bit spicy, I simply glide over those passages and enjoy the story itself. Quinn has a way of writing that is just so witty. I find myself smiling and laughing almost all the way through her books - they are lighthearted and yet her characters have a depth to them that make them come alive.

Because of Miss Bridgerton might actually my favorite of all of Quinn's books. I read it in one sitting. I didn't want it to end and now I have to wait for the next Quinn book - that's the only negative side to her books! :)"

I'm certainly looking forward to the next book to see where Artemis and Orion end up

I like to carry it in the 5th pocket of my jeans next to my leatherman sidekick with my main EDC knife in my main pocket and I never notice it's there. It's saved my butt a couple times too needing to find things in the dark or the last time I locked myself out of my truck. Bright enough for most utility tasks, solid construction, sturdy pocket clip and a simple single mode operation via a tailcap switch. For me this is a perfect EDC utility light."

If you have been following the story from the beginning, you will know that the characters are not the same as the first book.  The main characters are quite different from the first book and the story starts off very quickly and ends very abruptly.  I did not feel the need to go back and reread the first book to find out what I missed.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because I was left wanting more about the characters.  I felt like the story was rushed and just didn't flow well.  It is definitely a book that you should read.

I did not like the cover for this book.  The cover looks like it would be used to cover the main characters.  I wish the cover had been done in a different style.  There were a few typos, but not enough to detract from the"
1,"I am a father of 8 children, and we swear by the leappad learning system. With that said, the ""Little Touch"" is a great device with some caveats. I bought this toy for my son when he was 1, he was definitely not able to sit and ""play"" it by himself until about 2.5

I would have liked to have seen a better solution than the ""go"" button for turning pages, the ""age setting"" is in the book instead of on a parent-switch for this function.. My child happily changes the age setting as often as he presses anything else. It was a good idea, not having a stylus and it works fairly well.. Although my 9 month old smacks the pages and it doesn't actuate the touchpad.. It requires a ""poke"". The books are quite sturdy, they clip into the pad and are made of some kind of plastic material, very sturdy all in all. This is a great toy, and I'm glad I bought it, but it's not on the same page as the ""My first leappad"", ""Leappad"", ""Quantum Leappad"", or ""iQuest""."

Figured a silicone ring would be great. Turns out he loves it. He doesn't fiddle with it like his previous ring. He can easily do his work, workout, clean, etc without needing to take it off. It easily washes, so no fancy polishing needed. We like the multiple colors as well. It can be coordinated with the outfit he is wearing.

1,"MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

1,"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she receives from drunks, thugs and hoodlums that invade her home. Watch Olivia de Havilland's face in the final fade out, however, and you'll realize that these events represent a woman being forced to re-evaluate her life.

Previously the focus of her life had been the adored, pampered, 30 year old son who lived with her.  During her caged ordeal she learns that her son wants to leave home, taking half the contents of the safe.  If his wishes are not met, he will shoot himself.

Hitherto, the woman had been living in a kind of enclosed world, unchanging, suspended between two levels of reality.  Now, however, miraculously freed from it, is the world outside the ""cage"" a better one?  Her home is trashed, she has been beaten up by a thug, and her son is threatening suicide.

I believe the final fade out poses this question."

She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books.  I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving).

1,"We've had to switch brands multiple times when buying bully sticks.  The last one we loved but they are out of stock and no ETA on when more will be in.

These seem to be larger on average than others we have purchased, like someone picked the best ones ahead of time.  That was nice since even at the pet store, you might not have enough to pick that many choice ones.

But more importantly, they are the darker color my dog seems to prefer.  Some brands started out this way but then started selling packages were the sticks were more golden in color, and my dog didn't like those much.  I don't know if it's a change in how they process them, or what animal it comes from, but the dark ones seem to be the best.

I have a male Samoyed and when he's in the mood he'll reduce one of these by half or less in pretty short order, maybe 30 minutes or so, then finishes the entire thing later.  When they are good he'll even eat up any small pieces.  He's a big dog at almost 70 pounds though, and only water buffalo horns and bones last any length of time.

I've seen many reviews on many bully sticks wanting 'odorless' sticks.  I've not noticed them to be overly stinky but, it is a dried piece of animal, it does smell a little bit.  I don't even notice it unless I'm sitting by my dog, though."

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck!

1,"Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind begins with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for books of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.

The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind."

1,"Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning
Not durable"
1,"I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

All in all though it's a good harness, made well, and most importantly secure enough that it would be really hard for a dog to get out of it."

I was so excited for this movie to come out because it's difficult to find a good horror movie that's not ridiculous these days.

1,"I admire the author for many reasons--one for revealing so much of herself--and then not so much for undertaking the PCT but for undertaking it without any idea of what she was doing--putting herself into serious pain--and depite the conditions not giving up!!

""Into the Wild"" by John Krakauer comes to mind when reading the book. Cheryl running from her past--running from emotional pain--into a world of extremes on the PCT--not knowing what she will find in front of her--much like the character in Into the wild--unlike McCandless..fortunately for Cheryl--her ending was a good one!!!

For those who may choose to follow the path--searching for something--seek out some advice at least on equipment!! I'll bet if you ask Cheryl today if she could have shaved 20 pound off her load what the difference might have made....and I'm sure if you were able to ask Christopher McCandless if he would rethink going into the wild without a map which showed that there was a way across the river only 1/2 mile from the bus where he died--he would be the first to advocate being better prepared.

""Wild"" is truly inspirational-and highly recommended!"

1,"FEAR has a TV movie feel but it's actually somewhat above your average b-movie and Sheedy does a pretty good job with the material.  The antagonist and the storyline could have used a little more pep, but then it probably would have been even more like every other psycho-thriller.  It has some unique, if unlikely, aspects that pull me out of the movie a little.  Not that I totally discredit psychics, but the writer of this takes it to a new level that really could use something to give it a little more believability.  Still, this film has some tension at times.  Not worth the price of the set for it alone, however.  Now, same can't be said for PARENTS.  Truly, I bought this set for it alone and I was not disappointed.  I rented PARENTS when it first hit the video store and was blown away.  It made me seek out more black comedies.  It's really first rate and I was happy to find out it did hold up over the years.  The cast is great, the production design and storyline is terrific.  And as everyone has already stated, this film is in widesreen and looks mighty sweet.  NO COMPLAINTS.  I can't give this set 5 stars because I think FEAR is not worthy.  BUt if you can find this cheaper than the stated price, maybe $10 or so, then you're taking about a 5 star purchase."

1,"Highlights: Terrifying scenes of suspense and building of tension; immaculate cinematography depicting lifeless England; most of the performances, principally lead Cillian Murphy's and the reliable Brendan Gleeson's; alternative ending is KILLER.
Lowpoints: Too much zombies, too little subliminal terror at times; Megan Burns as the little girl is a truly terrible performance that fortuitously doesn't bring the film down.
Conclusion: An unflinching, metaphorical look at the possible loss of control over rage amongst humans, 28 Days Later marks Danny Boyle's comeback from his flop The Beach. Petrifying with its realism and astounding in its contrastive moods, 28 Days Later definitely has more in common with the director's dark masterpiece Trainspotting - it is scary, droll and compelling, and will linger with its audience, despite its flaws, long after the ending.

1,"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion.  ""Great Expectations"" is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens.  In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor.  His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since.  The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching.  Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.
""Great Expectations"" is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's ""Forbidden Colors"" to South Park.  An important and unforgettable novel!"
1,"A very interesting view into the mind and home life of Alfred Hitchcock. Anthony Hopkins once again acts his part so well that you forget it's him and just focus on the character. Helen Mirren is always excellent. Scarlett Johanssen tried to play Janet Leigh as smart and as professional as she was supposed to be - though I'm not sure she pulled it off. The actor portraying Anthony Perkins seemed to be playing Norman Bates rather than Anthony Perkins but perhaps there are more similarities there than I am aware. I was pleased that the Hitchcock's marriage was shown to be a loving, though imperfect, partnership and proved the saying, 'behind every good man is a great (and very tired) woman."

1,"The plot is good, the acting is good and the scenery is good.  The only fault I can find with this movie is the language.  The cursing is mild with only a few uses of three different expletives.  I have decided to rate (the many) movies I watch myself from the perspective of a Christian man looking for entertainment that won't teach my child to use curse words before her 3rd birthday.  I deduct 1 star for 1 or 2 expletives and automatically deduct another star for 3.  If I hear 4 or more or if any words are really offensive I stop it and it is rated 1 star regardless of any other considerations.  There is no nudity or blasphemous content.  This is one of those movies which makes no reference to God at all so it can't really be called Christian.  The rating systems in place are not adequate so I write my own reviews; I hope to help others like myself who would like to be forewarned if a movie is not acceptable viewing for the entire family.  This movie is not rated."
1,"I had a chance to listen to these at a local audio shop. I wasn't too impressed at all. Really disappointing sound quality considering the price. The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass. You'll learn to love and appreciate the more realistic sound other headphones provide, and your wallet will appreciate it too."

Baby V has found peace with the man of her dreams, but she won't have him withdrawing from her or keeping secrets that may keep them apart.

In this last book we find out what a honorable and protective man Dom is and how much he truly loves Baby V.  This is the kind of love that you dream about for yourself or you want for your daughter. What a great love story and conclusion.

In the photo, I really liked the wide strap, but it seemed bulky for me at the ankle and less dressy than I thought they'd be when I tried them on. In the end, I preferred the narrower strap and the width of the clog style Marcella Dansko and chose a 40 rather than a 39. (I have 4 pairs of Danskos which have lasted for 10 years and when you try them on in a store there is slight size and width variation even within the 39's because they are individually made, so on-line, maybe it is always best to size up if you are between sizes."

1,"Use With Care! This product worked wonders on the hair algae I couldn't get rid of. I tried everything first. I moved my tank away from sunlight. Changed to a lower light source. Set my lights on a timer. Sprayed things down with 3% hydrogen peroxide. Cleaned hard items in Clorox and then soaked in anti-chlorine water. Boiled my gravel. I mean I tried EVERY THING! I tried AgaeFix, but it caused my harlequin rasbora tetras great distress. I finally purchased this. I cleaned my tank very well with a 75% water change. I did the dosage of 1 drop per gallon. The tetras and Cory catfish took it well. My live plants looked fine. In fact I completed the 3 days of dosage with no trouble. My tank never developed algae after this for a month. The sand, rocks, plants, glass look great! Wow!!! So here is the caution. I believe from what I read that the chemical can lower the oxygen level in the water, the first time cleaning my tank for maintenance, I thought I would do this again-as a preventative. My tetras on the third day are clearly distressed again. From what I read if you see your fish gulping at the top of the water, they may not be getting enough oxygen. Mine were not this time, but I have two very busy air stones and a good filter system in my 20 gal tank. My small goldfish in my five gal did not do so well, and died. I think the were not able to tolerate this stuff. So, this is what I think. If you have tried everything else, try it. Use it when you really need to get the algae under control. If you have not used it before on a particular type of fish, go slow, and maybe try half the dosage. More is not always better."

1,"I purchased 3 of them with great expectations.  Using supplied sortware, I got only one camera on my computer, and could not get the other 2 on with it. At set up, I tried using: first Wireless and later with cable 5e.  Just could not get them to work all together. I gave up and they are sitting unplugged in the corner for over 2 months.

Anyway, when you can get all 3 on supplied software on my PC, instructions want you to go into the Router security system's guts and change access for external viewing. We depend on the router for our living, working from home when away from office, and we dare not tamper with the internal setting of our router and risk loss of work and income.  A big mysterious disappointment.

I may buy another router, taking our main router off line , and trying to get the cameras to work with a 2nd router.  If I mess up internet connection  with that 2nd router (while trying open access on the 2nd router for internet viewing) I can always take the 2nd router off-line and plug back in our old, great working, reliable router. I may try that next month.

1,"My girl, who is 7, is in that ""mommy"" stage and really wanted this doll. It might be good for younger children, but at her age it just wasn't a good match. As some others have mentioned, the clothing does not come off. A huge part of the fun, at least with my child, is dressing up her dolls in different outfits. Also, because of the way the clothing is sewn on, it does not lift up far enough for you to really put the diaper up around the doll's bottom. So the diaper was a waste as well. The quality of the doll's hair was horrible! She looked like she was going bald! If I had to do it all over again I would buy a Baby Alive. At least you can change their clothes, they actually have real looking diapers (not like this one which was a thin piece of cloth, not even resembling a diaper) and they actually eat and drink. This one may be a hit with younger toddlers but not for girls who are older than 5. And even at that, I would NOT pay $45+ dollars for this. It should be $20 at the most."

The only downside is that it's very hard to mount.  The ring itself is a bit loose and that means it won't fit in the pocket.  Otherwise it is very secure.  The only downside is that it's a bit loose and it can be difficult to hold it in your hand.

1,"UPDATE: finally installed this front sight - it was much easier than i thought - found out that Ruger used red loctite, but with a good gunsmith screwdriver got the original iron sight off...

at first i though that this was just an OK front sight - the 'tubes' didn't really seem that translucent, but after installation i have no complaints and stuck with the original green tube...

but still, although this sight is touted for the Rugers, the included screw is only for Brownings! How effed up is that?

It's good there are three 'pipes' included, but the descriptions/pictorials on the back of this cheaper product don't match up with what you'll receive... but just because it was lower cost than others out there, doesn't mean it doesn't work OK

but take a look at the 'key' in your package and the 'key' shown in the product printing... you'll see a difference - product photo needs to be updated

i'll be fair and try an install and outing at the range and will downgrade/upgrade afterwards... but from what i can tell, the substance used in the pipes, is, like most reviewers here report, inferior to that of other optic sights..."

1,"I've spent years hitting and missing this whole idea of carrying my shopping bags into the store with me when I go shopping -- so i don't have to carry paper or plastic out with me when I leave...  The Chico-Bags finally fixed the problem of leaving them at home -- leaving them in the car -- having too many or not enough....

since each bag wads up into a little light-weight ball of nothing -- and has a clip -- I just clip one to my bag and leave it there all the time.  I keep half a dozen of them in the back floorboard of the car -- when I stop at the store, I just grab them and clip them onto the one already dangling there as a reminder...  I end up with a multi-colored daisy chain of bags.

When I get home and carry my bags of groceries up -- I just toss the empty bags on the table, and when I sit down with a cup of coffee -- I start stuffing them back into their little pouches, and clipping them back onto my purse.

As long as I never leave without my purse -- I never leave without my Chicos.

Haven't been without them since.

And now everybody I know will be getting them for their birthday....  :D

I keep both the regular shopping bag size for produce and heavy things -- and the Vita size which are much bigger and really good for carrying paper good and chips and such."

1,"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in theater.  Its Andrew Dice Clay's first feature film and it delivers the typical Dice-persona antics.  Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?

The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...

He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, ""hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry""; classic stuff.

Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton's character(Julien Grendel).

If you want to brush up on classic 90s films or just a decent comedy in general, check this one out.  His comedic style may or may not work for you, but I think if you start watching it and your entertained you'll be pleased with this one."

1,"As a reader who is not an aficionado of speculative fiction or alternative historical fiction, this novel left me rather perplexed. Having read Robert Harris Fatherland a number of years ago (and having enjoyed it) and spurred by the popularity of the Amazon TV series inspired by Dicks novel, I dove in.

Set in an alternate post-WWII America that has been divided by the victorious Japanese and Nazis, the narrative focuses on five or six characters whose stories never quite coalesce; the fragmented narrative structure in itself is not necessarily a flaw (plenty of good novels feature fragmented narratives), but in Dicks novel, it definitely creates a lack of coherence that ultimately enervates the novel. More than half the book is devoted to exposition, but the payoffwhich doesnt really emerge until the final three chapters or so, once again in very fragmented fashionfeels uncertain and anticlimactic. Complicating matters is a novel within the novel, an alternate history that presumes the Allies had won the war but is itself different from the actual historical record (e.g., FDR did not serve four terms as President). Excerpts from this novel, called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, along with the I Ching, which every character seems to consult for guidance, appear throughout the story, yet again these elements fail to add any sort of coherence to the narrative.

Perhaps my lack of expertise in this genre handicaps my appreciation of this novel (which did, after all, win the Hugo Award), but I was, in the end, disappointed."

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is."

1,"Actually, having attended a number of academic conferences myself, I am not sure this is a satire. Quite a few of the ""fictitious"" presentations in this book sported titles (and contents) that were uncomfortably familiar. (What can I say? I was young...I didn't know any better...)  As for the back-biting, infighting, petty scheming, feuds, and general unmitigated nastiness--it's all too true. Fortunately, in Lodge's hands, it's also funny enough to take the sting out of some of the more pointed barbs.

And, if Lodge's lampoon of academia isn't enough to tickle your funny bone, you'll surely get a laugh out of the misguided kidnapping, adultery, unrequited love, requited love, strippers, porn, a journey around the world, and one of the most hilarious scenes in print (a karaoke bar in Tokyo that was definitely lost in translation).

Lodge's writing is a pleasure to read. He is clever (without being precious), ironic, poignant, even lyrical in places. As befitting a novel about literary criticism, there are references to everyone we know and love: Shakespeare (All's Well That Ends Well), Oscar Wilde (The Importance of Being Ernest--the twins are found in a Gladstone bag), and, naturally, the Grail Quest with all of its incumbent post-modernist/feminist permutations. I was thoroughly delighted to see that Lodge even referenced himself. (On page 280 Angelica's father bemoans the ignorance about identical twins. He mentions that he ""didn't have the patience"" to read a novel which featured identical twins of opposite sexes. The novel was David Lodge's ""Changing Places."")

You will find this book gut-wrenchingly funny if you are in academia.  If you are not, well, just enjoy your flight."

1,"no more rusty rake! this little kit is a must have for any scoopfree box! i've been using it for a month and cleaned it for the first time this morning. the dirt wipes off easily like butter (excuse the image. :P). the reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because i just encountered a problem this weekend. when i installed the rake a month ago, i noticed the two 'ears' if you will, were slightly scraping the side of the box. it wasn't an issue at the beginning until i realized this past weekend, instead of raking the box with the bottom of the tines pointing forward, the rake is raking with the top of the tines pointing forward, which completely defeated the purpose of the box. i'm guessing the box was giving the rake a counter-force at the 'ears' where they are scratching each other. it made the rake move harder. i was able to fix it in about 15mins. here's how:
1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake."

I'm disabled so the ease of use is perfect for my needs. When my nephew saw this dolly, he loved it. So I bought one for him to use when he transports his wares to comic/anime conventions.

1,"Volume 2 will continue the chronological release of the early sound Our Gang (Little Rascals) comedies from 1930 & 1931:
A Tough Winter
Pups Is Pups
Teacher's Pet
School's Out
Helping Grandma
Love Business
Little Daddy
Bargain Day
Fly My Kite
Big Ears

Jackie Cooper shines here as he falls for his teacher Miss Crabtree and has to compete with Chubby Chaney in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""School's Out"" & ""Love Business"".
Wheezer takes the main stage in ""Pups IS Pups"" but the early gang is all there as they invade an animal show with their exotic pets.
The gang's love for an elderly lady who acts as their Grandmother is heartwarming yet great fun in ""Helping Grandma"" & ""Fly My Kite"".
One clinker here is ""Big Ears"" which is a melodrama dealing with divorce.

Over all Volume 2 is much stronger than Volume 1, it is apparent that the Hal Roach Studios have become comfortable with their new sound apparatus and can now focus on producing funny comedies again.

For those looking for Spanky, he will not turn up until Volume 3.

1,"Gotta say - I love this figure! One of the more interesting depictions of the Joker in quite some time (in addition to Capullo's ""ripped off face Joker""), I like everything about this figure's look. Reminds me of a creepy, Prohibition era gangster type look, and it works well for a character who was created in the early 40's. Articulation is kind of limited, but what you would expect for a character in a suit - so not bad. My only complaint is the paint applications under his eyes. The creepy pinkish hue only goes under his eyes on mine - leaving the space directly under his menacing brows still white. I would have preferred that the pink go all the way up under his brows, but still a great looking figure!"

1,"I loved this story from start to finish. Alana Ankh has created a whole new world that is filled with magic and is very compelling. When Ivy and Kris meet they are not supposed to have a connection to each other because they come from different races and have a different set of cultural norms however despite these superficial differences they can't stop thinking about each other. When Kris devises a way to get Ivy with him again it works and Ivy becomes Kris's concubine; flouting the wishes of his parents and breaking a betrothal. Ivy and Kris have a kind of whirlwind romance that has political repercussions for Kris. This story has love at first sight, fights both physical and verbal, societal pressure, and two men that fight through all of that nonsense to make a real life together."

1,"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

3.5 stars because of its amazing storytelling."

The clothing is very pretty and my 5 year old granddaughter tester loved the way the skirt pops out and gives a different look.  You have to use your hands though to put it back down.

One problem I noticed is that the doll cannot stand up and there is no stand to put it on.  It is also a ""display"" sort of Barbie which has to continue wearing the same clothing so the absence of a stand is confusing.  For the 5 year old it is enough that she is pretty but older girls might want a way to display her."

They were all involved in vastly different situations yet I still had trouble differentiating between them. I did like the twist at the end where she did a good job of bringing the stories together. I'd read her again though, just because I like author who come up some clever idea."

1,"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon)."

1,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began."

Let me tell you about Taboo: 1. It kills time! 2. Sooooooooooooo much FUN... that sometimes you lose time laughing instead of helping your team :-) 3. It gets those small minded people very annoyed, mad and angry when they lose or fail... which I enjoy :-) 4. You lose control... 5. Very challenging if played between good teams. 6. Once you start you can never stop playing it.

As a 56 year old woman, I can say that the author really ""gets it"" about keeping the passion in your life way past what many people think you can.  It's a story that really appeals to women as it addresses the challenges of life, losing someone you truly adored, and then managing somehow to find somebody else who can fill the void in your life that you never thought could ever be found again.  In fact, if it was not for the light BDSM elements in the story, this could actually be made into a movie for Lifetime, Hallmark, or Up."

The way it was shot, I was willing to let go of considering its budget.  The ""acting"" was not the worst I've seen (and can make B films diverting at times) ... it was consistently poor, though, and I couldn't find much redeeming value.  About half an hour into the film, where it made some attempt at becoming exciting, I just had to give up and move on."
1,"It should have worked, because It's a fun idea, but it falls painfully flat. It's hard to imagine Michael York as a serious seducer for one, and two, Angela Lansbury gives a performance that suggests that she is on a stage. It was a box office disaster, and you can see why. Harold Prince was a great stage director in his prime, unmatched really, but his two efforts into film, this and the appalling mess he made of 'A Little Night Music' revealed that he just didn't know what to do with the camera, or how to direct actors for film. Someone should turn it into a musical. I think it could work really work."

Since she grew from 12lb to 30 lbs in 2 months, for curiosity, I decided to have her DNA tested. As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier. This could explain why she is growing quickly but also she is somewhat smaller than Mastiff's her current age (now 5 months) . After researching those breeds on the interent and learning about training, skill and mannerisms, I can now understand her better. I highly recommend this test."

Once I realized what it was truly about, it became much easier to wade through the diversions that are set up with too much going on about minute details and the thoughts of the characters.  More action would have pleased me but I guess I am just accustomed to the masters of those kinds of books.

One needs to remember that it was written so long ago that the prose is, to me, cumbersome and Lewis goes on and on about things philosophizing at great length about the smallest issue. I felt I had to stick with it in spite of this because by the time I began to see this, I had already invested too much time in the reading of it.

I enjoyed this last book in the series more than the first two."

1,"I had a Tekton mini bolt cutter, but this is much better.  The HK Porter has a maximum opening of nearly 1/2"" (7/16ths of an inch at the very top of the V opening) which means it opens more than twice as wide as the Tekton.  There is enough strength to cut through framing nails (.131"" or thereabouts) with little difficulty; wood screws cut like butter.  Also, while the Tekton has a flip-up wire catch at the bottom to hold the tool closed, the HKP has a slightly clumsy but perfectly effective thumb catch at the top, just below the cutter head - it works from either side, making the tool left- as well as right-handed.

The tool has a very comfortable soft plastic grip.  It feels solid and works effectively.  It does lack the Tekton's limiter screw.  It would not cut the only bolt I tried it on (neither does the Tekton), but scored it enough to guide an oscillating blade."

1,"Rand Al'Thor is the Dragon Reborn, destined to defeat the Dark One and give his life to save the world while he destroys it in his madness.
He sets off alone, searching for his own identity in hopes of proving what he is to himself. He searches for Callandor, the Sword That Is Not a Sword, the Sword That Cannot Be Touched. No hand but the true Dragon Reborn can break its wards and draw it.
But, as with everything, it is not that simple. There is always a challenge and it is a battle to the finish that threatens to send him over the edge of sanity.
Robert Jordan continues his tale with the third installment of The Wheel of Time, better still than the Great Hunt.
With four dimensional characters, a vivid vision and the most complicated plot of any story, Jordan transcends the fantastic, discovering a tale truer than any text book, a story for all stories, a legend for all time."

1,"Denons ear-bud headphones are simple, comfortable to wear, and offer high sound quality.

The Denons are understated, but stylish.  They have polished end caps, with dark chrome accents.  The materials and the fit and finish are high.  Included with the headphones are three silicon ear tips; small, medium, and large.  Also included is a short extension cable, although I am unsure what anyone would need it for.  I never needed it when using the Denons with my iPhone 5s.

The Denons have a small built-in microphone and a single button that is attached a couple of inches down from the right ear-bud.  The button allows you to control music playback and take calls/use voice command.  Its very intuitive and simple to use.

Sound quality of the Denons is high.  I listened to all types of music, from jazz, to country, to pop and all of it sounded nice.  Bass was strong without being overpowering, and high were also nicely rendered.  Overall, I found they produced very balanced and attractive sound.  Since the Denons close off the opening of the ear canal so well I was also able to hear subtle instruments and vocals that I would have missed otherwise.  The one downside of their excellent noise isolation is that I could also hear myself breathing at times.

The Denons are comfortable and I found that the medium sized ear tips fit my average sized ears best.  The headphones fit snuggly, but are never uncomfortable, and even after walking briskly for a mile they only shifted a little bit.  Im not sure they are made for running, but for modest activity levels they should work fine.  They are also light in weight.  The cord is long enough to not tug on the headphones when you move, but not so long that it gets in the way.

All in all you cant ask for much more from ear-buds."

1,"I tried these earhones and I waited and waited and finally when they came I was so happy. Well when I was trying to pull them out of their tight packaging one of them slightly snapped. They  still sounded the same, but they didn't look it. The bass is probably the only thing that is really good about these like I said before. The mids are somewhat there and the highs are almost no where to be found. The sound isolation was okay, blocking some noise while music was playing but my previous Etymotic Er6i isolators did a much better job for 40$ more. I did insert them all the way into my ears, for what seemed to be as far as they could go. All in all, if all you need is bass consider these, if not just look elsewhere.

Oh yeah, I have a newer ipod, so sound coming from it is bound to be good. So there should be no problems coming from the music side."

It has a practical approach and it is not full of unrealistic goals that are impossible to keep, like most of the diet books out there. I have been searching for the diet to work for me and after a lot of books with unrealistic methods and goals, I have finally found one that I believe will work for me. I showed my mom this book and this is the same weight loss approach that she has been using and she has been losing weight very steadily. I'm so excited to start. With no major holidays coming up, I'm going to start immediately. Another thing I really liked about the book is how the author tells more about herself and her life than just the diet period. It makes it so much easier to relate to. The cute pictures were just an added bonus. I loved it and will share it with my friends and family. If you haven't gotten it yet.....

1,"I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

The heartache and sorrow the characters felt. I know there are men out there who are very controlling of their girlfriend and spouse and this book shows a little bit of how one can be manipulated and cut off from their family. It is a pretty quick read because you will not want to put it down. I recommend this book and really enjoyed reading it. When it was done I wanted to know more about the characters.

Dual Stage Furnace works as designed even though this thermostat is manufactured by Honeywell (and is a lot cheaper than the Trane branded thermostats).  Very happy with this Honeywell unit and like the various customization features it offers me.  FYI, the Wi-Fi feature works as they all do; i.e., your smart phone connects to your home wi-fi connection, which then connects to Honeywell's server via the internet, with the Honeywell server then sending your commands back to your home wi-fi connection via the internet, which then communicates directly with the thermostat unit.  Thus, your smartphone interacts with Honeywell's off-site server and not directly within-your-house with your thermostat unit."

Henry's book was worth the wait.  I loved that the conflict facing the couple was not external to them but internal fears that the Diana most conquer before getting her happily ever after.  After reading so many books that have gentlemen spies or villains it was nice to read a book that focused on the characters and their relationship.

1,"A solid watch for the sub-$20 category, I was a little disappointed because I bought it because I thought it looked sleek/cool but when the watch got here and I took a closer look, I realized it was much more plastic-y than it looks in the picture.  Most of the knobs and buttons on the side are just decorative and aren't really buttons or controls.  There are only 4 buttons on the watch that are functional.

That being said, this watch probably does everything you expect from a watch of this price/category.  It is waterproof, has 4 different modes, including regular,alarm, stop watch, and secondary watch(displays a second set of time).  There is also a weird calendar mode, but the watch essentially tells you the date and day of the week as well.

Overall this is a great watch for the price, although it looks a little bit cheap, it really just looks like it's a sub-$20 watch, which it is.

I've brought it in the shower and into a swimming pool with me and had no problems, so it seems great for water sports and activities."

I'm not sure how many hits they can take, but I use them often at the range to help smooth out the break-point firing twitches.  A marksman friend of mine told me to use these to smooth out the trigger pull and these virtually eliminate that anticipatory twitch.  Also, my friend and I would shoot round robin and load eachother's mags with randomly placed snap caps so that you would not really know if the gun would fire; a great exercise to smooth out the trigger pull."

This wholesome book clearly reflects strong Biblical values of purity, honesty, respect to elders, obedience, conflict resolution,  and more.

I know it would be more of a struggle for me to give up all my modern conveniences and technology to live this simpler life style. This is the second book I have read in this Amish Girls Series and look forward to reading more in this series and by this author."

1,"Having lived in a cave for the last decade or so, I confess I had no knowledge of Jeremy Wade and his ""River Monsters"" television show. Glancing at the 'New Books' section of my local library, I spotted RIVER MONSTERS..and I was hooked. I'm glad I happened to spot Wade's book; it's a fascinating and informative guide to freshwater beasties few people even knew existed.

For the past 20-odd years, Wade, a Brit zoologist with a touch of Indiana Jones thrown in, has been traipsing the globe, searching for legendary freshwater fish. In RIVER MONSTERS, he shares the results of his quest and the results are eye-openers. Wade's descriptions of his efforts to find, fish for and land goliath tigerfish, arapaima, goonch, ripsaw catfish and longfin eels are wonderfully exciting, excitement only topped by the wonder of seeing actual photographs of those - often humungous - creatures. Along the way, Wade imparts valuable information on his finny friends and how they, in some cases, acquired fearsome if undeserved reputations as man-killers.

Yet, exciting as Wade's adventures are, there is a cautionary note running throughout the book. Overfishing is taking its toll of fishlife, large and small, worldwide and Wade points out the fact that many of the freshwater beasties he tangled with are threatened with extinction.

In short, RIVER MONSTERS is an appealing, exciting and insightful guide to aquatic wonders that - may still - lurk in freshwater rivers. Recommended."

1,"This is truly a fantastic little class d amp with good clarity and enough punch to drive a few bass notes.

I have used a variety of these little class d type amps over the years to drive aux sound in spare rooms, garage and the like.  Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped.
now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.

When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.

Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.

1,"Chuck Palahniuk is most known as the author of Fight Club, the book that became the movie with Brad Pitt and Ed Norton; and overnight Palahniuk had a cult following. Erie, scary, and terrifying; if I had to use three words to describe this book, that would be it. Robert A. Heinlien the classic Science Fiction author once quipped ""One man's theology is another man's belly laugh."" Of this book I would state, ""One man's perversion is another man's pleasure."" This book will hit both, depending on who you are and your sensibilities.

This book is a collection of short stories, written by characters who are on a writer's retreat. They all responded to an ad to ""give up three months of your life and create the masterpiece you have always said you would"". Each of the 18 respondents had an idea of where they would be going - to a large country estate, a camp in the woods; yet the reality is they get locked into an old ornate theatre house. They have food, shelter, and facilities, yet all doors are locked, all windows bricked over and no way out.

From there the book becomes a cross between Fear Factor, Survivor and your most feared horror story. We see the depths to which people will descend to achieve fame and riches. Palahniuk, during the current book tour, was reading the first story called `Guts' and to date there have been 63 people who have passed out with many people being injured falling into book cases in book stores. This book will at times, turn your stomach, but will give you an understanding of the darkest side of human nature.

Readers beware! This book is like the fight club movie on super steroids.

1,"This movie is unfortunately different from the book as others have detailed.  For myself, I found that key Christian symbolism (the purpose of these stories) was removed, and in its place is far too much emphasis on a statement from Aslan that things never happen the same way twice.  Beyond having no great meaning, ironically, the scene occurs twice, with Aslan saying the same thing twice about things not happening the same way twice.  Worthless.  Where is the emphasis on Nikabrik's disbelief in the Narnians' tales of a savior, and where is the emphasis on the faith of Caspian, Cornelius, and Trufflehunter in a savior that lived many years ago who not only died but lived again and will return?  Their dialogue should have been the highlight of the film as it was for me in the book.

Incidentally, who else hated the repeated nauseating Reepicheep jokes?  ""You're a mouse!!""  Ugh.  They ruined such a great character.  But there are too many complaints about this film to list them all.

I intend to own the version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from the same series.  I was so pleased with its faithfulness to the novel, and I looked forward to seeing the other books adapted. However, despite the good things they did in Prince Caspian, overall it was too disappointing to watch again, and I have no desire to watch The Voyage of the Dawn Treader."

The story follows a couple who find themselves in the middle of a dangerous and dangerous situation. While in a very dangerous situation, they both have issues to work on. The characters are well developed and the storyline is full of action. The author does a great job of bringing the characters together and making the situation interesting.

1,"Dracula
too long & too slow

Keanu Reeves was probably the weakest link.  His British accent has been described as too posh.  His acting is wooden & unconvincing.

Winon Rider is fine though her British accent is also overdone (though more convincing than Keanu's).

The costumes and makeup are amazing

Frankenstein

Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier."
1,"I can't fathom how the glowing reviews on this product could possibly be real. I just received mine yesterday, just in time to pick my cat up from the vet, after having surgery.

I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

I would NOT recommend buying this carrier. I've had it for 24 hours, and it already looks like it's years old."

1,"This unit has a very clean low distortion rate and delivers very high quality sound, the only negitive is that is not automatic set-up and it is a little complecated to set-up.
This unit makes a very good addition to a home theater and the Harman Kardon AVR-154 delivers very good sound for theater and music buffs.
I would highly recomend it to anyone looking for a low cost but very effective system. I was and is a much better system than Sony,Phillips, Magnavox and others in it's price range."
1,"I actually really like the look of it and when closing it it appears to create a pretty airtight fit.
Two things come across as a bit misleading though;

a) There is in no way a vacuum created or maintained, and
b) I can not see how it will allow for gases to escape.

Apart from that it's a neat looking container that appears to create a airtight space for my coffee beans.
Will use it for some time now to see how it makes my beans smell and taste :)"

1,"I sampled the book, then bought it. I found Scott Adams insights and experience match what I've seen work.

I marked it up for my youngest son, just starting out as an adult. Then I bought two more copies - one for oldest son, and another to replace mine. Adams' style is accessible and clear.

A few key takeaways:

- Use systems, not goals
- Try not to sell your time due to limited upside; your time is finite and limited
- Try to find a product that is infinitely scalable, that you can sell again and again (Intellectual Property might be one way)
- Piecing together complementary skills can make you _very_ much more effective
- Look to maximize your personal energy - the foundation of all else

==

The above are all key enablers for someone starting off. Scott Adams lays out a system to effectively experiment your way to personal success.

I strongly recommend this book to new graduates and anyone trying to be more effective on their own terms."

The recipes are fun and failsafe. The're so tasty that my meat-and-potatoes husband was delighted AND unaware that he was eating healthy alternatives. If there's a more delicious breakfast that Fab 5 Banana Pancake minis, I don't know what it could be. The best part for waist watchers is that Hungry Girl's website includes Weight Watchers points for each dish so you can stay on track. Trust me, try it, this is NOT your mother's ""diet"" food!"

The twist bulbs produce less heat than the older style incandescent light bulbs. A 60 watt maximum for incandescent light bulbs, which produced a dim yellow light and lots of heat, is too limited. The electric cord had a long ""flag"" label wrapped around it, with an admonition to not remove it. Ha! Right! I'm going to leave the stupid label to interfere with my using the electric cord, safely! Time to design a lamp for the modern bulb, fluorescent or LED. Otherwise, this lamp provides a convenient but basic light."

1,"I found The Business of Being Born to be very informative and definitely worth watching, I highly recommend it. I have only a couple complaints:

1. A bit of nudity towards the end, my husband and I would've appreciated more modesty. I've had one hospital birth, two home-births, with a third at the end of this year. I can therefore say with some measure of authority that it's not necessary to walk around topless or nude. Yes, birth is perfectly natural. So is sex, urination, and defecation. I'm not going to do any of those on screen.

2. I like home-birth because it feels so right, I have no other way to explain it. I'm a major advocate for home-birth, but what I can't stand is the ""movement"" associated with it. I do the home-birth because it's better for the child being born, the rest of the family, as well as myself (barring an emergency comes up, obviously). It's about mommy and baby, not ""empowerment"" and ""I am woman, hear me roar"". It's irritating and, in my opinion, it degrades women who choose to home-birth."
1,"Roman Polanski, born on august 18, 1933, has written a fascinating autobiography. He is a sinner and a genius, a chaotic man and a passionate, he is a machismo and a vulnerable human being, he overcame the WWII, the Polish ghettos and the Holocaust as a resilient child and he lost his wife Sharon Tate and an unborn child in 1969 by the Manson Group massacre, and on the other hand he overcame (as an adult) a special pattern of machismo-self-destruction (with 13 year old girl accusing him of sexual contact). He had lived a lousy life in Nazi-surpressed Polish ghettos and he had lived with too much pride and arrogance in Hollywood, he was arrested in the United States and nevertheless now he releases movies in Paris (presently married with French actress Emmanuelle Seigner). He is a gifted filmmaker and indeed: a writer, better than any crime-author I know; his book, published in 1984, is not a larmoyant, self-pitiful autobiography alike 1001 others - it is an absorbing story about a personality-mixture-hybrid of a Robin Hood mixed with Mac Beth, an Idi Amin mixed with a Mother Theresa, it is the story of ""Roman"" P., who started his life 1933 in Paris as ""Raymond"" P.; the first sentence of his autobiography: ""For as far back as I can remember, the line between fantasy and reality has been hopelessly blurred."" That became his helping trick to survive some struggles and tragedies, downfalls and comebacks ..."

1,"These boys pajamas are great for my toddler son now that the summer heat is approaching us quickly. These pajamas are made of 100% cotton and wash nicely. They are not the softest pajamas I have purchased for him, but after a couple washes/dries they have already gained a more comfortable feel. They're nice and lightweight for the summer heat. I purchased size 3T for my 34"", 30 pound 18 month old and they fit great with some room to grow in. He typically wears 2T-3T in clothing, so I'd say these are true to size. The shirt is long and narrow - it has a nice fit on my son. I like that this shirt is tag less - my kiddo often tugs at shirts with tags, as his skin is quite sensitive. The shorts come down to his knees and are a ""fitted"" style but a little loose on my boy. I like that in pjs - I feel that would be more comfortable during his sleep. My son enjoys wearing his new pjs and actually pulled them out of his pajama draw to wear when it was time to get ready for bed. He approves!

1,"I was surprised at how heavy air could be! The product also comes from Sam's Club, so don't be confused when you receive a Sam's Club package at your doorstep. Nonetheless, I'm pleased to be able to purchase these in bulk. I was worried one can would run out in the middle of cleaning my computer fans (the main purpose I made this purchase), so I figured it would be best if I had extra at hand. The instructions are quite clear on the bottle--no shaking of the product before or after use, can will get cold throughout duration of use, be careful not to be in direct contact of the compressed air as it can cause frost bite, etc.

Lastly, every single can--and I received four just as pictured on the product description--has their own red tube for hard to reach places. One can was also sufficient in cleaning up my macbook pro computer fans with plenty of air to spare!"

1,"I pitched this fun device as a drone to my son, who thought it was the best thing in the world.  We took it to the local soccer field and we were off! Or rather, we were off to a wobbly start.

The Jump Jet is technically a Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicle, capable of rising and descending like a helicopter and buzzing around in the air like a plane.  We liken it to Windblade, the Autobot who transforms into a VTOL jet.

The Jump Jet looks like a jet but it takes off like a helicopter, which means it ascends by drifting backward and then launching upward.  It takes some maneuvering to get this right, as it's not one helicopter blade over the center but two blades, which causes the drift.  There's even a control to adjust for this drift, but good luck using those while you're trying to get the Jump Jet to take off.

Once it takes off, there's another button to transform it (see?) into jet mode.  I was torn between shouting ""Form of...a JET!"" and making that sound Transformers make when they do it, but my kids were already nervous about flying this thing in public so I decided to keep their embarrassment to a minimum.

The transformation to jet comes suddenly, which requires a completely different set of flying skills.  Where before I was simply trying to keep the thing from crashing into the ground or to a child, now it's a matter of keeping it aloft and moving forward.

I took me several tries to get the Jump Jet to take off, transform into jet mode, fly around, and then transform back into helicopter mode to land.  By the time I finally managed it, it was out of power.

My eight-year-old tried this several times and was never able to get it, but he was very helpful in running all over creation to bring it back from the latest crash landing."
1,Love this peeler.  I had purchased one a few years ago and somehow it got lost.  I tried to replace it with other brands and they just didn't do the job as well.  This time I purchased two just in case.  Would recommend it to everyone.
1,"This set of books is an excellent read.... if you enjoy drama, friendship, loyalty, trust, allegiance, pride, & the redemption of those who sincerely need a hand up... the warriors who are absolute in devotion & dedication to our country, these books are a great insight. God Bless our Military & those who serve. ( although these are stories, they hold a wealth of understanding of our warriors )
Recommended reading....waiting for the next story."

My husband is disabled and cannot tolerate the tight bottom leg opening caused by elastic.  I simply removed the elastic to relax the leg opening and they are fine.  However if I order another pair I will reread the description to make sure there is NOT any elastic in the leg opening."
1,"Mel Brooks has done some very funny and halarious movies but Young Frankenstien has to be one of the all time best. Totally shot in black and white and spoofing Mary Shelly's Frankenstien with Great Honor, this film has an amzaing cast and the humor is simplist and fun not rantchy or stupid but comic genius if only there could be more like this the movie world would be such a better place. Young Frankenstien is a True All-time Classic Comedy."

1,"Easy to assemble.  Took me only a few minutes to put it all together.  Comes with instructions and a small wrench.  I weight 180lbs and it holds up very well using all variations of grip.  Only advice, use tape or towel to wrap up parts that presses against the wall to prevent marks and scratches and reinforce the some what weak black foam that it comes with.  Other than that, everything works as advertise.  Just put it to work and be consistences, a healthy diet then everything else will follow. =)

The waist is a bit loose and the sleeves aren't tight. The shirt is very soft and warm and is very warm. I love it. I love the color and the fit. It is a little heavier than I expected but I will keep it. I am 5'6"" and 190 pounds and I ordered a medium in this one. The shirt was a little large for my bust but I usually wear a medium. It is definitely a medium but it is too big for me to wear it in public. I'm 5'6"" and 140 pounds and the shirt was a little too large for me to wear it in public. I have a small bust and the medium was just too small. It was perfect for me. I would definitely recommend this shirt to anyone. I am 5'8"" and 155 pounds and ordered a medium in this one. The shirt was a little large for me but it is a nice shirt for my bust and I can wear it all day long. I would recommend this shirt to anyone.

I really didn't know how it was going to work out. As usual, the characters are their awesome selves. The book was filled with betrayal, action, and drama worth reading. I was satisfied with the ending of the pretend story told in the hospital room and the actual story. It made me hopeful for a better future to make the sacrifice worth it. The book held my attention the whole way through. I'm not really sure what else to say. I really thought it was well put together."

I'm usually a 10 but have a smaller chest and had to wear a padded bra to fill out the front.
1,"Censorship and moral codes took the bite out of screwball comedy as the 1930s progressed, but in the 1940s such directors as Howard Hawks and Preston Sturges found ways to revive the genre in very high style.  Not only is THE LADY EVE one of Sturge's best, it is also one of the finest in the entire genre, a comedy so potent that even the most jaded will be completely charmed.
There is no way to describe the story without spoiling the fun, so suffice to say the plot concerns the heir to a fortune (Fonda)who is beset by a beautiful but predatory card shark (Stanwyck)--and who looses considerably more than his heart in the process. Considered racy for its time, Stanwyck's... manipulation of Fonda is one of the funniest elements of the film, and the movie as a whole abounds with ""Garden of Eden"" motifs: the name Eve, apples, and (of course) a snake.  Everything moves along at a fast pace and with plenty of crackle, so there's never a dull moment, and the exceptional supporting cast includes witty performances from Charles Coburn, Eugene Pallette, William Demarest, Eric Blore, and a host of others. It would be hard to imagine any one who wouldn't enjoy seeing this film at least once--and like the best films, THE LADY EVE does not give up all her secrets in one whack. The story and performances bear up under repeated viewings.  Comedy fans will enjoy it again and again!"

The Wave is made of a material that is highly viscous, which is why it was so popular. The wave also has a 2-piece design to it, which is great for a wedding band. I also like the shape of the wave, which is nice for wedding ceremonies. The waves are very easy to wash and dry, which is a nice feature. I really like the wave.

I was very surprised at how well the Wave worked. It was a little too warm for me to wear on a chilly day, but it was a nice touch. It also kept my hair from getting stuck on my head. I also liked that the wave was made of a good material. I wish it had a thicker material, but I don't think I will"

1,"I've always been a sucker for a bad boy who comes back to a town from his youth and tries to makes up for past mistakes! This is such a book. But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father. There's a lot to do in Butterfly Harbor and he's going to do his best to help the struggling town but he's going to need Holly's help...if she'll just forgive him. I love this book and all the characters were fantastic! I can't wait for the next book in the series!"

1,"The continuation of the compelling wild wild west in 2087:  The Doctor is a player, a wolf shifter and has a rowdy family of brothers and cousins. While helping his brother claim the woman he has loved for years, Parker meets and literally falls for her friend, Lynn.  When the bad guys come to town looking for his soon to be sister in law, a fight ensues with a lot of needed healing for the doc.

Lynn is injured and taken to Parker's hospital/office.  When she wakes she immediately starts working with the doc to save lives and treat outlaws and good guys alike.  While amazed at her ability, and his protective, possessive attitude they work side by side.  She expects him to belittle her ability.  She's not prepared for his desires and her response.

There is a hilarious scene with Parker's Mom and Dad where some of Lynn's secrets are revealed.  Alpha male attitude towards his mama will make you laugh out loud.

This one has it all, strong, sexy shifter, who can put his foot in his mouth in a flash, romance, hot sex and a great ending.

At this time there are more books scheduled but not yet published yet--I will be watching for their release date to read more about this family of males fall."

1,"I gave this Peet dryer 5 stars because it performs in exactly the way I expected it to when I purchased it.  We have basketball shoes that need to be dried each night after practice and tennis shoes that have been out in the snow and gotten soaked.  The Peet Dryer has a button so I can choose heat or no heat.  It also has a dial that allows me to choose how long it will run.  The timer goes up to 240 minutes.
The first time I used the dryer, I couldn't really tell if it was working.  I could hardly feel any air moving out of the shoe extenders.  I was wondering if it would work... it did.  It's easy to use and fairly quiet, so I can keep it plugged in and doing it's drying job in the entry way of our home and not be aware that it's running.  The unit is pretty lightweight, but not cheaply made.  The vertical extenders that I put the shoes on are thick plastic and removable.  The center fan/digital unit is attached to the base.  I can move it from place to place easily.
I use this item everyday.  It works well to dry the inside of wet or sweaty shoes.  I would recommend the dryer to anyone who wanted to preserve and protect their shoe investment.
I have no ""cons"" to share.  It's a simple concept that works well for athletic shoes and it's priced reasonably."

To be truthful I still prefer it over the wave; however, there are times when I have gotten beans and they taste significantly better on the Wave, usually beans from South America. The only real gripe with this pourover method is the filters. At the mercy of these pricey things. I say this because there have been a couple times where I accidentally overpour with my kettle when preheating the dripper/prewetting the filter. What happens with overpour is sometimes the weight of the water will cause creases in the filter and mess up the distribution of the water. You end up with a less tasty cup."

1,"Kuuga Rising Ultimate first off, has amazing detail. From head to toe, the figure is a work of art. Every bit of detail is painted and sculpted to the point where it really is show accurate. The sculpt is so good that even the tips of the armor that point out have sharp feel to them. Even his Arcle (the transformation belt) has ridiculously awesome detail for something so small. Articulation wise, he has the same ones as the SH Figuarts series, albeit on a smaller scale. He does have accessories: interchangeable hands (default closed fists, open relaxed hands, a thumbs up hand and a transformation related hand) and an alternate head that depicts his ""dark form."" One thing that people won't expect from this line of figures is the scale. Compared to SH Figuarts, these are almost half the size. Those used to the SH Figuarts scale may have a hard time adjusting, but it's really not that bad. Matter of fact, despite the size that this line (S.I.C.) uses, all their figures have amazing detail. The same care put into the detailing of SH Figuarts is present in this line as well. Overall, this figure is great. It's a great add to my collection. If you're a fan of the show, character, or just love collecting figures, get this, it's a solid purchase!"

He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great."
0,"I ordered the lobster costume and it arrived with a very small opening.  The dimensions were just right.  The costume is very tall and the size is perfect for a small dog.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase.I was skeptical about the price for this product but I found it a bit too expensive. I did get a medium and a large but the medium was great. I just wish it came in a different color for my dog because it is hard to see her from the side of the house. I would have been happy with the medium. I was just too big for my dog and the size is too small for my dog. I have a 14 lb dog and I found this size and it was perfect. I can see why the price was a bit high but I was able to find it at a very good price. I will never buy this again.Very cute, very well made and really works.  I would buy again if I were able to.

1,"Oh, unf. I have loved every word of The London Lovers. Silas and Molly were such a fantastic match and they flew off the page with Sierra Simone's talented and passionate mind.
Molly overcame so much and Silas' devotion is swoon worthy. Fortunately, he likes to take your breath away in other, more exciting, ways.
Silas is a package and a half. He keeps Molly (and us) on edge with his dirty talk and his tenderness. It's an enigma and I love hearing all the sexy details coming out of his mouth.
This conclusion provides resolution for Molly. Her character was so very strong and determined and justice was served through the help of her devoted friends and Silas. She is a champion and you can't help but wonder how many ""Mollys"" were broken because of the situation they were born into.
If you read the first London Lovers, you will read this one. You have to have loved both. Sierra Simone never disappoints and I can't wait for the next  journey."

1,Bought these a few weeks ago... Used them for 3 or 4 thirty mile rides... Then wore them for my 1st ever Seattle to Portland Bicycle Classic (2011). Rode from Seattle to home Saturday(114 miles) no butt pain or chaffing! Washed and hung to dry... Then wore them again for the Sunday. Around mile 70 or so of the second day butt got pretty sore but that's not bad after 180+ miles in two days... The ride totaled 106.68 miles with the small detour we took... butt a little sore but NO blisters!!! Overall I say they are darn good riding shorts!!!

1,"After watching the film I got the novella ready for a good comparation. Coraline is one of the few cases where the film is much better than the book. I think that the main problem is that the original work is intended for young readers. Therefore, the development of the plot and the building of the characters is over simplistic. That is, if you are a grown up reader, probably this novel will not satisfy you. It is too short, and the characters are very sketchy. They lack depth and so does the story. However, if I were to recommend this book to a young reader, I certainly would. If you are looking to read something from this author, probably The Graveyard Book, while still a novella, gets closer to what a mature reader expects. In any case, watch the film. You will not be disappointed."

I had this on my Kindle Fire when I purchased it but didn't think much about it because i have owned so many Kindles before.  Well one night i had no internet access and all i had was this manual on my Kindle to read...because i had no other new books at the time.. i was amazed at what i could actually do with my Kindle Fire.  I am so glad i read this Manual.  My Kindle experience has been broadened.  I will never look at my other Kindles the same as I see my Kindle Fire.
1,"The day after I ordered this my husband came home with a DC40 Animal which he got at a warehouse store for way less.  Since it was a gift and included an upholstery brush I kept it and returned the one I ordered which, as an aside, was super easy.

I love the Dyson.  While it's kind of heavy and the ball thing is awkward the cleaning power is phenomenal. Don't have carpeting but the area rugs look almost new.
Am kind of partial to bagless vacs...gives me an instant return on my efforts by seeing what I've actually picked up and this canister is easy to empty.

The cord is plenty long as is the hose, great for my high ceilinged rooms.

The time to assemble the machine was approx 10 minutes, so easy I wondered if I had done it right.  Have read complaints about the instruction manual but I found it as adequate as I needed it to be.

Another thing which convinced me that the Dyson cleans better than any machine I've owned is that after a weekly vac I can use my Roomba and the little robot doesn't constantly bog down and need cleaning.  It can complete an entire cleaning cycle without begging for help.  In a household with 2 dogs and a cat that is something.

Yeah, I love my Dyson and so does the iRobot. We're both happy now."

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

After his purchase is finished he sets off for home but then Talia realizes he didn't sign the order forms and must contact him, her Aunts push her to call and after that it settled on a meeting Cedar then calls back and invites her to his Grandmothers house for dinner and to witness the Full Moon ceremony with him.

1,"Why you should read it: This has been one of my favorite reads this month, and I definitely recommend it to fans of the twisted and strange. Brandon is a bad boy who uses his image to hold the world at bay, and uses his hacking skills to keep the world at arm's length. Our heroine, Emma, really sees him, which is why I think Brandon really connects with her. Now on to the plot! I think some readers will have a hard time suspending disbelief, but if you do it's a really, really intriguing concept. Without giving too much away, the mirrors are a separate ""world,"" and Brandon can hack them from his computer. His reflection, Obran, is everything he is  and isn't. My husband works with coding and computers, so when I read aloud some of the coding and hacking, he thought the idea was really cool and promptly went to look at his reflection. For tech-oriented readers and those looking for something different, I'd recommend Duplicity and am eagerly awaiting the next installment!

She uses it for a lot of things, including drawing, pictures, etc. She loves it!Works perfectly, no problems with the software or even my keyboard.

I ended up putting this on my cat and putting his rabies tag in it since he is an outdoor/indoor cat. He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.

Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom. My husband suggested I put the tags on a carabiner and then unclip it from her at night and when she is in the house so we don't have to listen to them jangle. Then I can just clip the carabiner back on her when she goes outside."
1,"This is the best accessory ever developed for concealed carry. Purchase this for all of mine and love everything about it. No more slippery grip and it doesn't make it hard to holster or pocket it. Treat yourself to this, you won't regret it! Not a single issue ever. Stays on nice, doesn't slip or slide. Used a blow drier then put it in the freezer for 10 minutes. They also don't leave any nasty marks if you were to take it off (peels off nice and easy). Like many have done, I also custom cut mine (didn't install the back grip or front because I have a laser)."

0,"V. is like some weird, dark fantasy, with a lot of twists and turns. I was just blown away by the way the author explained how the characters were different from each other, and how it was possible to change in the same way. I loved the way the author wrote the descriptions, and the way she used the same descriptive elements in the different stories. I loved how she kept the focus on the main characters, and kept it fresh.

The story itself was very well done, with the art style and the setting. I liked the fact that it was not just a fantasy story, but a true real life"
1,"I like how there are different puzzle options on each face of each block. Together they represent a food group, complete with info on each food type. The blocks are well made and feel solid.

I do appreciate the amount of information that's being presented on such a simple set."

1,"I bought this for my fianc, because we live in a bad area.

Pros:
-Much more natural to use/hold than a common can of pepper spray.
-Well built, feels solid.  It has a thick screw in piece in the back (like a flashlight) where you can remove the propellant.
-Detachable keychain is perfect.  It takes a good bit of force to detach, which is good.

Cons:
-Very short range.  We bought a practice spray canister to try it out, and the spray only has an effective range of about 5 feet.  At the end of this 5 feet it has turned into a cloud of mist, so any breeze will reduce the range even further or cause self harm by blowing it back in your face.  But it is still effective as a last resort close range spray.
-Button is easy to press.  Moving it forward and down does not take as much force as I expected, so it seems there is a risk of it going off accidentally in a purse or pocket, especially since the button is raised and can catch onto things.  This has not happened yet though.
-Extremely limited capacity.  the spray canister is TINY.  You only get a few short sprays out of this, or about a 3 second long spray.  This could be a pro for some, as its less likely a bad guy can use it against you once you unload it.
-As mentioned by others it looks inappropriate from the top.  Someone made some bad design choices on its appearance.

While there may appear to be more cons than pros, this serves its purpose as an easy to use, last resort, close range pepper spray.  It feels very natural and is easy to aim/conceal.  Its always ready if its on your keychain and can be detached if your keys are in the ignition.
I would recommend getting a practice canister to get used to how the button works and the aiming/effective range."

The lighter exercise band when stretched rolled up a few times on me and I would have to unroll and start again.  I guess because I was pulling it out so hard.  The others did fine.  I could feel the tightness with those as I stretched it out.  I may lay flat and try it on my ankles and legs next.  I left out of town so I have not been able to test it that way.  But I assure you, you will feel it in your arms.  I would consider buying these for my neighbor who also wants to work her arm muscles, because I do not want to loan mine out, as I will continue to use the tighter bands."

When it comes down to it...I enjoyed this book, and will read the next book by this author.  So...I would recommend it."
1,"I really like it! its got good coverage and is modest and sporty at the same time!

The reviews said the Bust ran big and you should believe this. To give you an idea on that..........
I'm a petite size small and sometimes medium. My shoulders and rib cage are slightly bigger than the typical ""petite"" size. I wear a size 3 to 5  jean and am 5 1"" or so with a B 1/2 cup size and 35 Bust..... I'm an in-betweener.
.I ordered the Med to give me more coverage But when I tried it on it WAS a little too big around by 1 inch and the straps are too long by 2 inches
I'm going to do the alteration on it and it will fit perfect. I guess I got the bigger size for a couple of  reasons:
I thought it would be too short and I didn't want to take a chance it would be too snug

I guess I could have ordered the small But I think the cup size would have been slightly too small? Well they can't make every body type I guess.lol
over all I really love  this Tankini. I like how there's a seam under the bust and pleats down the middle Bust to give support and the fabric gives good support too. The way the straps and cups are designed,gives the suit good coverage for a fuller cup size.

If I ordered another one I would try the small. I can't wait to wear it! this summer!

1,"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.

UPDATE--that third flashlight with the non-operational red LED's? It drained the batteries flat while turned off! Obviously a bad circuit. I threw it away. A 33% failure rate is nothing to brag about."

Then when we do get some action it seems to be written in such a way as to not worry or Frighten the youngest of readers.  At the very end  it got more  interesting to build up to the next book.

This is because the hooded lens hood is designed to allow for better light and better sharpness. The hooded lens hood is also designed to provide a better grip on the lens.

I also noticed that my lens hood was not able to hold the lens in the case that I was holding. This was due to the lens hood not having enough space for the lens hood.

I was able to remove the hood from the lens hood and place it in the case."

The basic design of the re-branded pliers is a little awkward to use, but they work well. The two-finger tips are great for fastening a screw to the back of the tool and it is a little tricky to use for just about anything else. I am not sure if they are a good design for the tool, but I would be fine with it. I will definitely buy again. I have a few other re-branded German pliers and they work great. I have to say that I like the color and the feel of the re-branded ones, but they are not as sharp as the originals. I would have to give these a 5 star if I could. I have a few other German pliers that I will probably never use again, but these are a great choice. I love this light. I have been using it for several months now and it is always bright.

1,"This short little novel, which spawned two films, one with Robert Donat and the other with Peter O'Toole, was originally a story Hilton wrote in November of 1933 for the Christmas issue of the British Weekly. It found its way across the pond to the U.S. and the Atlantic Monthly and became a smash hit. It was repackaged as a novel and went on to great reviews and big sales. The story revolves around an 80-ish man, Charles Edward Chipping or Mr. Chips, nearing the end of his life and his recollections of his times, tribulations and triumphs at the Brookfield all boys prep school in England, from before the turn of the century to the 1930s. It has a folksy, quaint, lacksadaisical feel to it, and the tone stays consistent throughout the moments of political strife within the institution, as well as the bombing of the school during WWI. Sweet, charming, inoffensive and ultimately slight and forgettable. If you want something meatier and more substantive from Hilton, try ""Lost Horizon,"" a terrific tale of Shangri-La. This one is fine if you have an hour and a half to kill."

1,"Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed."

Our puppy still came in with ticks after walks or after playing in the yard, and now she has lymes disease and goes through boughts of not being able to move. We had pay for expensive blood work and antibiotics. And she'll have this disease for the rest of her life. She isn't even 1 year old. My puppy got lymes thanks to frontline NOT WORKING.

1,"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price. Not to mention that I'll have to find time to go to the post office to send it (not something you are looking forward to when you just had a baby). Otherwise why would you shop online if you can go to the store to find bra that fits?
While I understand the reasons behind the return policy on things bought from a third party through Amazon, I wish I was better informed about it before I spent money on this bra."

0,"It's hard to find an actual set of these tools in the stores.  They are all pretty.  If you want to get a set that is as good as the ones I used to have, this is the one.  I think it's going to be a great choice for the money.  I have a few of them in the house and they are all so much more versatile and useful than the crappy plastic ones I replaced.  I'm hoping that when I buy another set of these tools, I'll have a set that does the same thing.

Bottom line:  These are really good.  I used them to replace the old tools that were replaced on the ceiling of my new home.  The old ones were too thin and didn't hold up well.  The new ones are much better.  I hope I'm buying a few more of these and they will last me a long time.

Update:  I bought two sets of these.  One set of these replaced all the old ones and the other one replaced all the old ones.  So, this was a very good deal.  The new set is much better.  I don't have any problems with the old ones.  The old ones were a bit stiff and the new ones are much better.  The old ones are well made and I like that they are plastic.  The plastic ones are more durable and more comfortable.  The plastic ones are good quality and"

1,"Bwa ha ha -- the master of the midnight movie is back, after far too long an absence from the scene, with what one might actually accept as the ultimate ""grrl power"" flick.

But acceptance is not Henenlotter's purpose here.  His aim as usual is to entertain, shock, and amuse, and he attains his goals on his accustomed shoe-string budget.

Indeed, part of the fun of this DVD is listening to the commentary, in which the outre auteur and his young white-boy-rapper producer describe the guerilla movie-making techniques they employed to realize this bizarre sexual fantasy.  The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!

And then there are the purple-hued ""penis-cam"" shots...

Suffice it to say that if you enjoy ""Something Weird"" videos, you will likely enjoy this film, which also features one of the most tragic ""happy endings"" you will ever see.

As the director says on the commentary, at the consummation of this unusual love story, ""Now there's something you don't see every day.""  That's what makes this film -- and Henenlotter himself -- so special..."
1,"When I first received the clip and turned it on, it froze while listening to the radio. I managed to get it unfroze by connecting it to the computer - holding down the power button didn't do anything.

I spent a little time transferring audio files to it, then it went dead completely. Won't turn on. Won't connect to computer.  Submitted it for return to Amazon today and now I have to wait another week to try it again.

Considering I bought some accessories to go with it, if I can't get a functioning mp3 player, I'll be pretty upset at the waste of time and money.

1,"If you are looking for a quick romantic fix this novella length book might be your answer.  Josh and Mindy are easy to like and they will have you rooting for them after just a few pages.  Mindy is going through a rough patch and what better than a handsome man from her past showing up stranded and looking so fine, to take her mind off her problems?

You could literally feel the tension in this book.  It grew to exploding.

I think my favorite scene may have been the cookie frosting scene.  :)

I loved the happily ever after ending.  It ended just how it was supposed to to make my world happy.

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a ""clean"" romance, this is probably not the book for you.  There is also some swearing."
1,"If I'd followed the fit guide they would have been a mess. Good thing I've lived with my petite self for so long I knew the larger size wouldn't work for me because I've got short hands. The smaller size is a bit snug, but not too tight. The length of palm from bottom of fingers to wrist is too long for me. They will be too long for any true petite leading to extra bunching in palm and thumb crease area. If you've got ""normal"" length fingers/hands they'll probably be fine.

The seam on the palm between the forefinger and thumb is fine on the left hand, but stiff, sharp and uncomfortable on the right hand. The padding doesn't seem like much, and there is still discomfort while riding, but post ride there is significantly less lingering discomfort than wearing none. The padding is in a great place to protect the meaty part of the lower palm. It seemed the middle of the palm didn't have much.

There are two very large tags in one glove, but I make sure they are folded up to the upper part of the hand vs. the palm and they haven't bothered me. The grey color is nice and the white parts help for hand signal visibility.  They were the best out of the 10 I tried on in a store, but there's room for improvement.

Still surprised that companies don't make goods in petite and tall versions of things. All the rest of the clothing fashion community can manage it, why not cycling?

Overall they're pretty good. If they were destroyed I'd get a pair again until I figure out that magical illusive well-fitting, perfectly padded pair."

1,"If you want the convenience of buying puppy training pads in bulk and want a great price this is a great choice. These Wee Wee brand pads are by Four Paws, the same company that makes the better quality pads sold at Petco and the other big box stores.

These pads are 22""X23"" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer ""odor control"". They work very well.

Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.

I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were ""improved"". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.

In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.

What does matter is the price and the convenience of buying in bulk. These pads are quite satisfactory."

1,"Its a good filter, easy to install, made of lightweight plastic (a good thing because it will not make the shower pipe droop down like the old heavy ones did) and it completely eliminates all the smell of chlorine and everyone stopped complaining of dry itchy skin after I installed it.

The only tip I should pass along is that the you install a new one, do instal the hose and point the hose at the drain, as close as you can get to the drain) then slowly turn up the water. The first few seconds that the water is running it will throw out some carbon from this filter. The carbon is, of course, completely harmless but its particles are so small that will get trapped in the texture of your shower floor and leave a black mark. It eventually goes away but it might be noticeable to some people.

The other tip I can offer is that this is an effective filter but it clogs up easily. There are only two of us that use the one in the master bath and it only lasts 4 months (once it lasted 5 months, I got al excited but the next one only lasted 5 months again). I do wish that it lasted longer because I have having to recycle the perfect shell, but that is a small wish for future versions.

Juno is living a dull life that is until the ghost of her mother shows up and starts to liven her life up which takes Juno down the path of reevaluating her life and wondering is she really living or has she been playing it safe this entire time. **Spoilers** There were so many times I wanted to shake some sense into Juno and point out all things she was ignoring about her life, like 1) being that her and her fiance Evan and her are better off as friends than a couple, 2) that her ""best friend"" is in love with Evan and that's why she never takes her side whenever they discuss what's going on in her relationship with him. 3) That her so call friend/co-worker is desperately trying to ride her back up the ladder instead of climbing up it himself, 4) that she doesn't want to climb up the ladder because she doesn't like her job, 5) that her and her neighbor from across the hall have sizzling sexual chemistry that you can start a fire with unlike her dull and routine relationship with Evan. *End of spoilers* Good book just wish it had more ghost interaction between her and her mother, would love a second book of Juno meeting Ryder's family and her seeing more ghosts."
1,"For sports fans, some of the best bits & more from the tv & radio show that is on a bit early if you're unemployed. Mike Greenberg takes charge most of the time. Mike Golic is now well into his second career as co-anchor of the show. He was a defensive lineman in the NFL for nine years. He seems chronically grumpy mainly because he has to to put up with ""nancy boy"" Mike Greenberg. For his next career Greenie wants to be baseball commissioner. He has some new rules for the game that make sense: more day games & bring back double headers which would in turn shorten the season so they wouldn't have to play outside in November in Minneapolis or New York or  Boston. Some make no sense. No soup will be served in any ball park. Bring back the troughs in the men's rooms, like in Wrigley field. Ah, tradition. They talk about the unwritten rules of baseball. They are moronic, numerous & as old as the game. I love them & woe be to the player that breaks them. Other sports are covered too. The ""sheets of integrity"" for ""March Madness"" college basketball is classic. Golic has no integrity when it comes picking his 64 teams. They have an annual wager that is a highlight & has included in the past Greenie milking a cow on live & Golic getting his rather hairy body waxed. But I almost forgot, this a book review not their show review. There are lots of really good pictures, thus you can read the book pretty quick. But you'll go back to read it again. For the real sports freak it is attractive enough to be a coffee-table book."

The only downside is that it's very small. I think it is the plastic part that is breaking down.

1,"Innovative design. I feel that it offers the best combination of gripping strength and openability that I have seen in a long-reach plier. The best part of the double X is that it allows the jaws to open wide while the shank stays relatively thin, which is key for areas you will be using this plier (restricted access).

I hate sloppy pliers. I feel that this plier has a low level of slop in the joints. Which is impressive considering that it has twice as many joints as a conventional plier.

1,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."

1,"This first- person narrative account of the years that Tavis Smiley spent in the company of Dr. Maya Angelou is a real eye opener.  I did not know that he had access to her in such a personal way through a friendship that lasted over 20 years.  She took him under her wing and it helps explains his success as one of the best interviewers I have seen.  Tavis, whom I admire, lets his guests speak what is in their hearts with little interruption yet through skillful guidance.  All of those precious moments with the wise Dr. Maya surely added to his views and open-mindedness about life in general.  This is a great read and I could not put it down.  I saw her speak in Boston and I have read and cherished most of her works, but this puts an even greater spin on her illustrious life.  Thank you, Tavis Smiley.  I feel that I know her even better, now."
1,Although it is a very nice item. It was missing the short extension poll and after it was assembled and the box had been tossed; I noticed a crack in the glass fixture.  I checked the upper part but did not Check the bottom part where the chain was.  This is so large I would like a glass light replacement. It is cumbersome and gives off an Amber light instead of an clear light for we reading. Perhaps l should just return the intire item in a differ container if I can it get a larger watt bulb or a glass replace and a long chain. Too many issues thus item I believe was a Used even the box had been opened and retaped. Just send me anew set unopened.
1,"I am changing my review (shown below). This item is poorly made. After wearing to sleep at night over a 2 week period, it sprung a major leak. I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open. I can sleep comfortably on my side or back. it comes with a cloth bag for storage."
1,"I can't believe an item can work so well and cost almost nothing. This ring is solid, well built and fits my 77mm lenses properly. I am using it on my Canon 70-200 Mark II lens and Canon 17-40 wide angle. I bought it because my 24-70 lens is 82mm and I decided to buy filters that are 82mm in size. With this baby I can now use my 82mm filters on both of my 77mm lenses and thus, I save money in the long run.

No need to buy expensive rings. This is the one. Do it now and don't look back."

1,"This product is unfortunately junk. The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils. I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend."

1,"First, the outstanding quality of Joanne Harris' writing is her use of mouth-watering culinary descriptions.
Her plot here is much more involved than in Blackberry Wine, and much darker.  I happen to like the darker in terms of reading (my favorite is C.J. Cherryh's Cyteen; check THAT out), but I do have to say the narrator was hard to sit next to for the length of the book.  Witty and earnest and devious as a child; witty and earnest as a sixty-year-old, but much crankier, and though she retains her spirit, she has lost the deviousness which made her younger self a delight.  Case in point:  When a loud neighbor and competitor moves in, her strategies to combat him are downright ordinary, exactly what youth would expect of the rigid elderly.  Her triumph is the sort of thing I can see my grandmother sitting in her living room telling to her elderly friends, while they nod in agreement.  ""And >I< told HIM...""
Some of the reviews seem appalled that the younger Framboise went to such measures to torment her ""poor"" mother.  Poor nothing!  Framboise fought back in what was an intolerable environment.  By the end of the novel one can see her mother does care about her children (though unable to show it) and has her own problems, but one is still hard-pressed not to root for Framboise and her siblings in the situation.
I do have to agree with one reviewer and say kudos to Paul for sticking around the whole time, though I can't see why he does.  Framboise is fortunate he does.
All in all, a great character sketch of the lesser parts of being human.  And the ending made me want to put down the book and go on in denial, making up my own ending and pretending it was the real one -- but that's good, it means it's powerful.  Sad is more powerful than happy."

These may be flatware designed for hikers/campers, but they are still flatware. And at this price, I'd expect their design to be more tasteful. Any branding should be on the back, in an inconspicuous location (the same as any 20 piece, $10, set of flatware for four from wally world).

They were also packages in a fashion that allowed for them to rub against each other during transit, causing abrasion marks. Rolling them in a simple piece of paper could've have seen them to my door in better shape!

Otherwise, they are light-weight, and they functions as one might expect."

After using this for a while, taking off a star.  The base is slightly wobbly which is annoying.  However, the price is low.  So it's still an okay product.

UPDATE 11/3/15: Dropping this down to two stars.  After only a few months of ownership the simple soldering joints where the vertical poles attach to the base broke.  This holder is decorative.  However, it is cheaply assembled and quality control missed the mark on this one.  We'll be looking elsewhere for a replacement.  The brand is fine, but this model is flimsy and weak."

1,"These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long."

1,"I'm a perfectionist, in all I do and in my work; I expect the same pride in workmanship and design as I put into my own designs and products...

This cheap, thin, tin-like metal has no substance to it at all; its tantamount to a polished tin can. The 'anti spill' ring (atop the bowl) is too large for small breeds such as my 20 pound Shih-Tzu.  It arrived with the rubber, anti-slide/anti-skid, gasket detached, it falls off very easily and is nearly impossible to replace without stretching it, which totally defeats its purpose, in that it falls off almost every time you pick it up.

There is a hollow space under the anti spill, upper rim, that is impossible to keep clean.  Having no instructions, enclosed, who could possibly know that upper anti spill rim is designed to come off?  Good luck managing that feat and be careful not to pinch your skin both wrestling it off and getting it back on.  Having shopped finer boating and camping stores, I found this is a really bad knock off of the ones I have found since.

My really good dog food bowls are stainless steel, incredibly heavy and have lasted 3 lifetimes (dog lives) they cost a small fortune when I bought them 20 years ago, but were more than worth it.  I was looking for comparable water bowls when giving this a try; and it is not even close to being close.

Unless you only need this for the boat or camper for a week or two and a few weekends a year...  Do yourself a favor and buy heavy duty, stainless steel and don't have names put on (unless removable).  Spend the money once and never again.  My twenty year old bowls look brand new, even after 20 years of dishwasher abuse.  Whereas, my week old Indipets bowl is ALREADY scratched, falling apart and has pinched my finger so hard I still have a huge blood blister on my finger.."

But, I decided that because it did the job I had hoped it would, I would give it 4 stars.
I would have given it 5 stars, except that after a couple of weeks, the foam padding on the kneeling board is showing signs of breaking down.
It will not last much longer.
I'll have to figure out a way to replace the padding with a good memory foam.
Then, it'll be a good kneeling chair.

With that said, I love the chair, or what ever you want to call it.
I've had it for about 3 weeks now.
My lower back, leg and foot problems are dissipating nicely.
I was worried that I might be turning diabetic.
A checkup confirmed that I wasn't.
The problems were most likely being caused by LONG HOURS sitting in front of a monitor.

It took a couple of weeks for my knees to begin getting used to it.
But, they're adapting nicely. Which is a good sign for anyone else because I'm in my 70's.
Anyone younger should should have an easier time getting used to it.

Using a piece of good firm memory foam on the knee board should make this an excellent kneeling chair."

I was very impressed that the food caused no stomach upset, even though we switched to it without blending his old food.  In fact, his regular ""old dog"" gas was actually greatly reduced using this food, which is a major plus.  I also really like the fact that it has anti-oxidants.  The only downside is that the first ingredient is corn meal, which is a little disappointing.

1,"What a Great reel! If your new to baitcasters this is the one to get. I've got 3 chronarch c+4's, a curado, two abu Garcia Revo's, a Lews BB1 and a few other bass pro baitcasters. The T-wing system really is awesome. I also like how there isn't a side plate to open(especially if your new to baitcasters) because I was adjusting my ci4+ and the side plate fell in the lake once!!! I also usually put new bearings in my reels, but I don't this one needs it, because of how far it casts. The size of this reel makes it great for your palm, and is pretty light, and I'm comparing it to my Shimano Ci4+'s which are very light. I am by no means new to using baitcasters, but if I were to recommend one to someone that has very limited experience or is just buying their first one, I'd strongly recommend this as its pretty hard to backlash...

Pros
- My son really liked this rash guard/sunscreen top.
- The unique white stitching gives it some style (over just plain black).
- We ordered one size up from his normal size, and it fits quite snugly, so the sizing is about
  two sizes smaller than his typical American size shirt.
- It is well sewn and dries quickly.

Cons
- If ordering again, he would probably order two sizes up from his normal size.

I would purchase this product again.

I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item.  I find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I cant hold or touch the products before buying them.  So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item Im thinking about purchasing.  I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others  to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality). I received this item at a discount or gratis from the manufacturer or a seller to objectively test and review it, but received no payment and have no obligation to offer anything other than my real opinion based on my experience.

We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French movie that is dubbed in English and it is weird.  There are a lot of violent and bizarre scenes.  Very mild spoilers for examples: the midwife rips Jack's frozen heart out and replaces it with a cuckoo-clock?  Lots of bullying, including stabbing in the eye.  The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!  What?).  Again, steampunk fans who are teen and up may enjoy this.

1,"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake."

I learned about the great battles of New York and the importance of war.  I learned about the growth of the country and the men who made it.

1,"Reporter, Jeff Mann (James Cardwell) is busy blackmailing the local gangsters. Obviously, this is a dangerous undertaking for Mann, who quickly winds up deceased in his own office. Oh no! The assassin was disguised as well-known, masked crime-fighter, THE SHADOW! Now, the police are after the mysterious hero. Can THE SHADOW's alter-ego, Lamont Cranston (Kane Richmond) track down the real killer, before the police close in? BEHIND THE MASK is more comedic than I'd expected, as the original SHADOW was a dark, almost sinister persona, able to frighten the criminal element he was pursuing. In this film, THE SHADOW is rather marginalized, while the unmasked Cranston does the sleuthing. While I did like this movie well enough, it's mostly for laughs. So, don't expect the more traditional, serious SHADOW..."

With the help of friends, both old a new, a rescue mission has launched.
I won't be giving away any spoilers, but we do get to add more pieces to the puzzle that is Rose.

0,These have a heavy base and an easy to grip handle.  The only reason I gave them 5 stars is because the box is a bit small but the plastic lid does hold it together.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the lid was cracked.  The lid is not a very strong lid.  I will update if I have any issues with the lid.  I just put the lid on and the lid is on.

1,"I love this DVD! Rodney Yee DVD's from Gaiam have become some of my favorite practices. You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice. There are no detailed instructions, so I think it would be disappointing for a beginner.

I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.

I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.

It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...

Please see my other review on Amazon of yoga and meditation dvds."
1,"I purchased My Pal Violet as a gift for my nearly year old niece because my son has loved his My Pal Scout to pieces. Violet has been an incredible hit with my niece.

She has short violet and white fur with a plastic light up ""dog tag"" with Violet painted on it. She shouldn't be washed in the washing machine but you can spot clean her a little. The white fur doesn't easily release stains after a while, and beleive me, she will accumulate stains because she will be played with all the time.

Violet runs on 3 AAA batteries that are held within a plastic, screwed shut compartment inside of her velcroed back. We keep a small screw driver with our extra batteries for the toy so that changing them out is not such a problem.

She comes with a USB cable because it is a customizable toy if you own a computer. I will say that the better your internet connection, the better off you will be with this toy. Leapfrog doesn't have the easiest to navigate site. It is not user intuitive and usually takes a couple of tries to get any of our Leapfrog toys customized. The sync function at the end is an especial pain.

Violet has an ""on/off"" paw, a bedtime music paw, a musical paw with popular children's songs, and a paw that makes Violet talk with customizable phrases. You can make the bedtime music play for longer amounts of time by pressing it multiple times. You can customize what children's music the other paw plays. The remaining paw is conversation for your child and it is priceless to have the toy say ""I love you, (insert child's name)"". It also is customized with info such as you child's favorite food and color. Some of the conversation can be a little nonsensical but that is part of the fun, I suppose.

If it were a breeze to program and a little more educational, I would give it 5 stars. It is a great toy though and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for any child."

The ""5 in 1 Card Reader for iPad"" is big. It is larger than both the USB and SD card reader combined from the official Apple Connectivity Kit. I had a microSD-to-SD adapter already. This 5-in-1 is larger than all three of those pieces together. The 5-in-1 is definitely not made to Apple's quality standards. It also does not cost Apple prices. The one advantage of the 5-in-1 is that is is one piece so it is convenient when traveling. My conclusion is it is worth what I paid for it and is part of my travel bag. I continue to use my original Apple connectivity kit at home."

This one is a little heavier and heavier too.  It is very easy to clean and holds a lot of stuff.  I would highly recommend this product.

I have a few other products that are better quality.  These are probably the best quality that I have found.  I like that they are a bit small for my daughter's room.  I also like that they are a little easier to fit into the cabinet than my old ones.  I also like that they are very well made.  I would highly recommend this product.

1,"As I stated before: I am a Heavy girl, and I don't have a lot of time: This will not waste your time: do not let your weight deter you from getting these. [or time!] And then supplement them with leah Sarago's ballet body downloads. [again just do a google, you'll find them and they work hand in hand with the dvds].

Regarding the dvds:
Leah will slay you dead - and the beautiful part is that just when you think your thighs can't take anymore, guess what: glute time! and then rinse and repeat. The sequencing is magical, and just enough work and holds for you it to make a difference. Leah Sarago knows what she's doing and the results are nothing you've never seen - because you actually DO see them

[please note: Leah does work the thighs a LOT - so if you are prone to ""bulking"" I strongly suggest you do a good 15 minute stretch everytime you use this dvd. It helps your muscles develop properly, especially your glutes, which you work a lot anyway].

Your heart rate will go up, your legs will look fantastic. There is are rotations available to get maximum results. Again, regardless of your age or size or time, this will do the trick. [and supplement with the downloads! 93+ and counting!].

I always say Leah is love and I LOVE these dvds. Buy them. Do them. Get Results.
I am, and Ive lost almost 100lbs."
1,"I Was Looking For -
1) Large cavity satchel to carry paperwork when traveling overseas  2)  locking system  3) sturdy and lightweight

PROS  -  Locking system to keep others from getting in main compartment.  Lightweight and feels like sturdy material.  Strong straps with wire running through it.  Nice compartments as described by company.
Front pocket not very deep.  It is the length and depth of a boarding pass.  You can definitely fit other small objects in there as well.  It works.

CONS
1)  was expecting the bag cavity/opening to be larger but it wasn't, disappointing.  With the purse measuring 13"" at THE BOTTOM of the bag, THE TOP opening measures at 9 3/4"".  It does not open wide enough to slip in an 8X11"" paper/documents.  With the top not opening wide, this makes it restrictive to access things and harder to see into the bag. I have small hands and it's still awkward getting my hands in there.
2)  The lock and latch needs to be on the opposite side so it is in front of your body so you are not reaching behind you in an awkward movement to unlatch the purse.  I will be wearing this bag backwards with the latch in front for easy access.
3)  average plastic zipper, not a heavy duty kind of quality.

OVERALL -  I will be keeping the bag because I paid $25.00.  It's worth that at the top end but I would not pay more then that. If I did, I would have returned it.

I will use the bag as a day travel purse in crowded cities. If you are not opening it much, It will work great as a day carry bag for sure."

1,"I have been using the small Lasko heater for a couple of years now, and finally decided to upgrade to this bigger unit.  I like the small ones, but there are two problems - they offer very focused (almost painful) heat if you are too close, but are too small to sit farther away from them and still feel warm, and they don't heat up a large space.

This version is GREAT.  It's big enough that you don't have to be right next to it to get warm, it heats up my big room relatively quickly, and I *love* that it shuts itself off when it hits a certain temperature (my other Lasko does not).  This was well worth the money.  My other Lasko has lasted three years and is still going strong (I use it at work), so I expect this one will last for years, as well.  A great purchase."

1,"Outstanding product -- I needed a place to feed my skinny cats at their leisure, feed my handicapped kitten, and keep my fat cat on a diet. This works GREAT -- skinny cats love to play all over and jump up to the top house to feed when they are hungry; fat cat has a food timer next to the whole setup to feed her limited diet: she can't jump up and too fat to really want to go into the small house below, and the handicapped kitten gets fed canned food on the first level (she's learning where the food is still). Great solid product... it's rather large (we put in the basement - works out great), easy to put together, If you are a real cat lover - this is definitely a good investment. I have house rabbits too, and once things are set up for them near this condo - I think they will enjoy jumping on it and in the houses.

The fleece covering I'm sure will have to be replaced at some point - its not the highest quality: this is my only ""complaint"" if you can call it that,  but it's good enough. The product came quickly and fully intact."

When I got back to the front room where I had put it on my coffee table, it was 6:20 and it was still as cold as when I put the green tea lemonade in it at 10:00.

I have used this for about a year and it still works. My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. I took it to the vet and he told me that he had found a new toy that was very different and I was worried that it was not a toy he would be able to play with. I took it back and it is a great toy for him. He loves it. He has a very picky eater and will eat anything and anything. I love that it is made in the USA. My dog loves this toy.

After leaving this review about defective heater, the seller offered to replace it, so 5 stars for service.  I have received the replacement but haven't tried it yet as my turtle is in a stock tank outside & its been 105 degrees for past couple of weeks, he/she hasn't needed supplemental heat for now.  I am still going to buy a good, reliable heater to use as daily main heater though, even if this one works.  Also want to mention I did not receive the floating thermometer with either of these heaters.

Edit:  August 6, 2016
I have been using the replacement heater for about a week.  This one does work, however cant comment on longevity.  Very satisfied with seller for prompt replacement of defective heater."

I also like the fact that the sides are made of a metal material and not plastic. I would recommend them for anyone with an occasional rustic kitchen. I bought this as a gift and it has been great!  It is a little heavier than I expected but it works!  I used it to make a batch of a New England coffee for my son to make into a couple of quickies. He is very pleased with the design and the quality. I am happy with it and will buy it again. This is a very good, thick cover for my pillow. I don't know if it would be worth it to keep it at a room temperature, but I have it on my mattress with no problems. I wish it had a small, low profile cover that was just right for my husband to put on his pillow for a few minutes of sleep."

I loved that all of them had doubts, they sounded real. They felt lust, love, jelousy and all the things you feel when you are in love.
Another thing I adored: they are not ""perfect"".... they are very ""human""!
I also have a lot of fun with the side characters, and Iam crossing fingers to get their stories!

This is the first time I have had this product in a long time. I have had mine for two years now and it works well. I have also had it for several years and it works well. I like the way it is made. The handle is nice and strong. It fits snugly in my hand. The material is very durable and works well. The black leather is very comfortable. I love the fact that it has a silver case.

1,"We have had this for a year which is a pretty good length of time for a bath toy in our house. My boys got this as a gift from a friend for Christmas in 2014. It came without the suction cups to attach it, but I have  a textured tub so it  probably wouldn't have worked anyway. One of my sons has played with this pretty frequently, just sitting it on the ledge of the tub. He mostly pretended, because for it to work it has to be partially in the water. The floating gup that came with this was total crap and grew mold inside it, so I had to throw it out in the first month. The roller ripped in the first week, so out it went too. The rest of the unit has stayed functional, so we kept it. I am careful to squeeze the water out of it until no water squirts out after each bath use. But finally last week,  I noticed the blue tubing looked funny. I cut it open and it was growing black mold inside it. So I cut off the tubing and had to pry the plastic shower head off to get it all off. I then told my kid he could play with the housing like that since now water won't collect in it to grow mold. It is a fun toy, but designed very poorly for emptying. It will grow mold, no matter what you do..... it's just a matter of time."

1,"Money. What everyone wants. And when they get it, all they want is more. That is the basic concept behind Confidence. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a con man that makes his living by scamming people out of their money. Accompanied by his three buddies (Louis Lombardi, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Van Holt), the crew moves from city to city tricking people and stealing their money. But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is. There are numerous amounts of heist and con movies around right now, but this film tells the way people feel about money very well, while still keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Confidence is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that has also hopped to the top of the to buy list for me."

1,"The Brady Bunch - The Complete Fourth Season just keeps getting better. I really enjoyed every season even those weird Oliver episodes in the last season. The kids are older and the parents don't seem as square like in the first couple of seasons. I never was a fan of Alice, she's too boring. Jan was my favorite even though a lot of fans thought she was a drama queen. My favorite episodes from season 4 include: Today, I Am A Freshman, Jan, the Only Child, Greg's Triangle, Love and the Older Man, and Greg Gets Grounded. I highly recommend it!"
1,"To date, I have read Nikki's Secret, Text Message and Scrapping the Bone and I have to tell you, William Malmborg delivers. His stories are not for meek, but they are not so far out there that people will be offended or put off by reading them. What I love about Malmborg's work is that it is a little racey, a little raunchy and a whole lot of fun. The story lines flow. Once you start reading, you cannot stop. It's like opening up a huge bag of Dorito's and saying ""I'll just have a few"". Can't do it. You dive into one of his books and you will be reading until 4 am just to see what the heck Nikki's Secret is, or how is Mallory going to walk into that men's bathroom and do that thing? You just have to find out. Each book is a decadent pleasure, a pure delight that you can sink your teeth into and get lost in the process. Read this guy; if you like raunchy, sexy, a little crazy and a fabulous story."

1,"I've been waiting for these boots all my life.  I have had severe lower back problems for a couple of decades.  I can do pretty much everything, including walking, without too much discomfort, but standing for any period more than a couple of minutes is incredibly painful.  Last weekend I spent 6 hours on my feet in these boots while canning and I never got sore at all.  Without sounding hyperbolic, these boots are kind of life-changing for me.  No other ""comfort"" shoe or boot has ever made one bit of difference in how I can function; these boots allow me to do everything I never wanted to do before: shop; socialize on my feet; work, etc.
As for the fit, I sized down as I have with my other FitFlops and there's still a little bit of extra room.  I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick socks make sense.  They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pairs of regular weight socks.
As for how they look, when I first put them on I thought they looked a bit like moon boots or Earth Shoes.  I was ambivalent about wearing them for the first couple of days and just kept trying them on in front of the mirror until I got used to them.  Now I LOVE the way they look and have gotten many compliments on how cute and stylish they are.  The look is a bit of a departure for me, as I'm used to wearing a bigger, more masculine boot, like a biker boot or a Doc Marten.  But these are adorable.  I love the extra height they give me.  I love that I can tuck my pants in or wear them over.  I've pretty much worn them every day for the last couple of weeks.  I'm already looking at getting a suede pair.
Buy these boots.  They're everything."

1,It was easy to set up. The only thing is make sure the propeller is properly seated and if the propeller comes apart don't panic. Just press the rubber stops back on to each end of the silver pin. AND MAKE SURE there is water filled to the waterline on the filter hose or the top of the glass or it won't run. It aerates the water very well and I have two of them in my 75 gallon tank. The large unassembled carbon filters will fit well into the rounded filter casing but you only insert the carbon pouch MINUS the plastic. The filter housing that comes with this unit is durable and reusable. You just pinch the spring tab at the top and the carbon filter will come out the bottom. I just put it in today and there is just the noise of the water flowing back into the tank. I don't mind it at all. Just turn the TV up a notch.

Anthony Robbins, noted motivational/inspirational/self-help speaker and author has said many times, ""Success Leaves Clues!""  Gary Keller has taken the clues of many real estate investors and has created a book that shows you how they did it and explains how you can to.  Most millionaires in the U. S. either started by investing in real estate or a prominent part of their financial portfolio contains real estate investments.  This book takes you from the first investment sale to investing in many sales and clearly demonstrates how to avoid the pitfalls and going it alone mentality (no one can do it better than I can).

Now, what I can say is that Thankfully this Wonderful story was taken and revised to answer any and all questions a reader might think was left open. What really made me love this Author more is that the Editing that was done, was done with the utmost care, so that the flow and ebb of the story was so smooth that you read 'The End' too soon.

1,"The Buttkicker adds a bit of shake to your home theatre.  It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

All that said, it's a great addition.  If you can afford the cost-of-entry, you'll be amazed how shallow the system feels with it off."

1,"Crimson Eve, the 3rd book in Brandilyn Collins' Kanner Lake series, has been in my TBR stack for quite some time.  I read Violet Dawn (nicknamed Violent Dawn by my book club) and Amber Morn quite a while ago, but was not lost when I started this novel.  Really, they could probably be read as stand-alones, but I like to begin at the beginning.  The novel starts out running and really never quits.  Carla Radling is targeted by a hit man and is unsure just why someone wants her dead.  She literally stumbles into safety, but on the run, she can never be sure who to trust.  The story unfolds through present day action and the diary entries from Carla's 16 year old diary.  The switch between the two really works and the reader is not confused thanks to date entries at the top of chapters and a different font for the diary.  Crimson Eve is a good, quick read if you are looking for page turning suspense."

1,"Max finally killed Captain Kurklops. The last of his stuffing was in my hallway when I came home yesterday. He now happily carries around the rag wherever he goes.

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When we first got this toy, Max, an 8 month old pit puppy, managed to rip both of them within the first 10 minutes. However, after the initial tears, he managed to slow down with the toy destruction.

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

This toy is NOT meant for a serious game of tug of war. It's my dog's favorite game and he tore off a tentacle during our first and only game of tug. However its perfectly suited for indoor games of catch."
1,"Yes, this is a new writing style for the talented MS EDWARDS.  She has shown more talent than when she wrote as MS NICOLE EDWARDS. And, I didn't know that there ever was that much talent had existed.  Being able to write books that are that good and being that different is phenomenal. We are talking like two completely different people.

The book was great. I'm so excited about this series. And I can't wait for the next book.  This review will have no spoilers as I don't include them.  They can ruin a book if you include them in a review.

The editing was good.
The characterization was more than great.  All the characters had a perfect role they played.  Each of them could have their own unique story.
The storyline was unique and not boring. You are always waiting for the next page.
I gave it a 4.5 stars and then rounded it down. There was one or two chapters that was a little slow. But that was all.

I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I URGE YOU TO READ THIS FIRST BOOK OF THE SERIES.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU WILL WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SERIES.
SO, GET THE BOOK AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

The other one is a bit too much about the humans. He is the most annoying character in the book.

The plot is in good shape, but it's not very good. There's not much of a plot in this book, and it's not very good either. There are enough bad guys to keep the book from being a good read. The story is all about the humans, and that's fine, but it's not really important.

I'm not going to tell you why this book was rated so high, because I'll just say that I found it to be a bit of a disappointment. The writing was good, but the story was too depressing to really keep my interest. It's also a little hard to keep track of the characters in this book"

The pillow cradles your head for perfect comfort.  Fifteen minutes tumbling in the dryer at low heat restores the original shape and loft.  Coop has followed up twice since my purchase with tips on use and offers to correct any problem, but I have none.  Compared to other top line pillows, this one is top quality and value priced.  I would definitely purchase again!"
1,"I literally use this blender every day. It has replaced most all of my kitchen appliances!

We have no problems with chunky smoothies on the 1st try. We put carrot chunks, frozen spinach, giant chunks of frozen raspberries and they liquefy no problem. My toddler drinks her smoothies thru a sippy cup! I love that I can add fruits and veggies and even avocado for extra nutrition and they slurp it right up!

It chops nuts and veggies for easy cooking prep.

I make batter and dough in it effortlessly several times a week. We eat Paleo/gluten free, so I make most all muffins, cookies, cakes & breads from scratch. We even make homemade Lara bars in seconds!

The preprogrammed buttons apply to most everything you would want to do.

A Spatula can scrape out under the blades and get out every last bit (unlike Vitamix)

It fits under my kitchen cabinet (unlike Vitamix)

The blades are not sharp so no worry about you or your kids getting cut and they never dull (unlike Vitamix)

The recipe book is great a great guide for most anything you may want to do with this awesome blender!

8 year warranty and from what the rep (at Costco) said it's an easy process if needed

The best part may be the clean up. A cup or 2 of water and a few drops and let it rip. The cup is all one piece, so you don't have to take it apart to wash and then put it all back together again.

One thing to know in deciding between the 4-side and wild side cup, the wildside is bigger so makes more, but requires a bit more volume to work correctly, so if you want to make smaller smoothies or batches of batters you may prefer the 4 side cup."

1,"""Ordinary Men"" chronicles the rise and fall of Reserve Police Battalion 101, one of several units that took part in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question while in Poland. During the course of their stay, they were responsible for the shooting of 38,000 Jews, while also deporting 45,200 to the Treblinka Concentration Camp. The book argues that the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, and other units like it, were comprised of ordinary men. It begs the question: How did ordinary men become the cold-blooded killers of the Holocaust?

Author Christopher R. Browning does a tremendous job of covering the ground. He also presents a strong case that these people were indeed ordinary men, who came from ordinary backgrounds, only to end up being transformed into the murderers of thousands. However, the book also stresses that some of the men, including several officers, could not be considered ""ordinary,"" as they were trained in Hitler's Nazi organizations from youth. Browning also does something nearly impossible: He humanizes these people without excusing their horrendous actions. Their defense that ""they were just following orders"" just doesn't fit the bill, as some refused to take part in the actions, and asked to be relieved. If a few men could get themselves relieved from doing the killings, why did so many more not? That is the main question the book gives. ""Ordinary Men"" is an extraordinary book that chronicles just one unit that took part in the murder of innocent Jews, while also presenting a good case of how ordinary men can become killers. I highly recommend this book to all students of the Holocaust."

1,"The story of Damali Richards is a bit cliche...the ""chosen"" guardian of humanity against the forces of evil...she's a girl who falls for the wrong guy...the guy is killed by vampires and becomes on of the walking dead...yadda yadda yadda.  So, what makes L. A. Banks' story so interesting?

The most interesting twist to the general vampire fiction rule is the approach to the vampires themselves.  As the most powerful ""demonic"" force in all of Hell, outside of Satan himself, the vampires are the undead elite...snobs, if you will.  Their views toward other preternatural creatures can be seen as a vague social commentary of our world today.

Another interesting twist to the story is in the character of Carlos Riveria.  What becomes of a man who willingly sells his soul to evil but dies with a prayer in his heart?  The battle of good versus evil in the war for souls just got personal.

While the dialogue is a bit heavy handed at times...too much street slang and ""hip hop"" style references to be considered entirely credible...overall, I would have to say that Minion is a great read and a wonderful new take on an old fiction theme."

1,"Okay, as a reviewer of Sally Bedell Smith's new biography, ""Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of An Improbable Life"", am I judging the book or it's subject? This is a question I ask myself when I review any biography, particularly one of a controversial figure, like a politician or a royal figure, etc. In this case, it's sort of a toss-up; the book is well-written and the subject has gone through his life, making both bad and good decisions. These decisions - based often on whim and fancy - affect a fair number of people, pigs, and plants, and will continue to affect them, after he assumes the throne upon his 91 year old mother's death.

Bedell Smith's bio is just one of many that have been written about Charles over the years, along with the lot on other royal figures, particularly Diana. In the past, these bios have been heavily slanted during the Windsor marriage - Team Charles or Team Diana - but this one is drawn very even handily. The only problem with this book is that if you're a Royal Watcher, you've probably already read parts of this book ten times already under other titles, written by other authors. So, if you're a new reader, I can recommend this book. If you're an old hand at the Royals, you can probably skip it."

1,"The Lego Connoisseur Here, Reviewing the Snowspeeder.

True to my beliefs, we picked this up for $25.00 at Legoland.  Less than $0.10 a brick!

Believe it or not, we bought this for a three year old, hey it was Legoland and we were in the moment!  Probably should of known better all things considered...This Lego set feels very strong when built--durable even, through many battle simulations it has survived harsh environments and many gun shots!  Until his other brother shot it down with a fanfare of no other.  Not recommended for little kids since most battles end with a request for a rebuild, much to parents dismay.  However the largest one (ahem...) loves this Lego Star Wars Set.

First, it is a relatively older set.  I remember it when I was boy.  My friend had it (and all the other ones too).  Tons of fun, decent instructions to go along with it, but not quite as user friendly as the newer more, ""step by step"" instruction designs.  This felt more true to the old movie than many other sets without as many custom parts as those tend to have.  Plus Luke, with a light-saber is always awesome.

The few complaints I have is related to the cockpit...There really isn't enough room.  I wish they had built it up a little more so that the fighters could sit up straight.  I also which that Luke had some spot to put his light-saber in the cockpit.  I think the spring-shooting darts are a bit too sensitive, they went off several times without much input from me.  And finally, the little shooter by the grappling hook can easily fall out and it isn't exactly the easiest piece to put back on."

1,"""First Blood"" has to be, without a doubt, one of my favorite action films of all time. I believe that I enjoy it so much because it does a nice job of balancing action scenes with drama. Thus, this film does not reek of the overkill violence that plagues the two sequels (as well as the films of other action stars). Stallone actually does some acting in this film. His performance as a Vietnam Vet come home to find a thankless country is compelling and his emotional breakdown near the end of the film is fantastic. There is a lot of suspense in this film and the characters are certainly memorable. Rambo has a clear enemy in this film, played by Brian Dennehy. He is not taking on the country of Vietnam or the Russians-he is simply defending himself from a small-town cop. My recommendation is to see this film and forget about the two sequels. Of course, any die-hard Rambo fan will tell you that the action sequences only become better as the movies progressed, but they sacrifice much to do this in my opinion. If you enjoy action films with a little class, you'll love ""First Blood."

One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.

1,"An immediate return to Amazon, on their dime. Let the buyer beware. The holster provides more of a ""generic"" fit, intended for use with several pistol models. That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention. This holster doesn't come close to it in quality or functionality."
1,"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?  I'm sure the Delta engineers would love to blame this on faulty install or an inept homeowner, but the fact is the product is not designed to handle anything but perfect conditions, and real life never is."

The snaps are secure, but easy to close, and the legs snap all the way down to the foot, so it's a lot easier to put on and take off of little squirmy ones.  There are little foldover fabric covers for baby's hands to keep him/her from scratching, so you can eliminate the little mittens that don't seem to stay on.  The company guarantees satisfaction with their product, and this comes in numerous colors and several different sizes.

1,"This hat goes perfectly with the ""queen of hearts"" costume. It adds some cute flare for pictures. However, it did not work to wear the hat all night. The hat portion slides onto a headband. The hat gets very top heavy and makes the head band slide around on your head. Eventually if I didn't hold the hat in place it would fall down to beside my ears, if not fall of completely. After 30 minutes of use the hat broke completely.
The company did replace the hat, but the 2nd hat came in broken as well. I was so frustrated with return/shipping I just kept the 2nd hat and fixed it myself. I would not recommend that hat unless you would like to wear it for pictures only. To wear to a halloween party or dancing it does not work."

If you are using a pebble time, be cautious with Nato watch bands. 1, they cover the charging port 2. They have a tendency to damage the lockup mechanism. Just be cautious.

I did not like that there were zero instructions and I had to go online to find a walkthrough on how to install a Nato Band from a third party. The included parts kit was nice.

Thank you for taking the time to watch my video or read my review. If you found it helpful, please click the This was Helpful Button. To be 100% fair, I received this product at a free or reduced price in exchange for a fair and honest review. If I find that a product does not meet my minimum expectations for what it was designed to do, For Example a medical Kit that does not have the proper equipment to do what it says it can yet at least has some value, it is generally a 2-3 Star. As far as the review, if for example its a phone case that won't really protect your phone, you will hear about it here first. I like to show all the pros and cons in my videos of a product. If something does what it is supposed to do, its worth 4 stars in my opinion. If its an Excellent Product, then I like to reward the company with a 5 Star rating. If a product utterly fails while I am testing it, it receives a 1 star."

0,"This review is for one of the free books in this series.  This is the first book in the series.  The second book is also free.

This is a short story with a lot of sexual tension.  The story is told in two parts.  The first part is a fast paced story.  The second part is a more mature story.  I liked it a lot.  The story is told from the POV of the main character, Luke, who is a vampire hunter.  The sex scenes are very hot.  I liked that the main character, Luke, was a bit of a jerk, but it didn't bother me that he had a big heart.  The story was a bit different from the first book in the series.  I will be reading the first book in the series.

This book was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.  I was not disappointed in this book.  It was a good story.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  The characters were well written.  I was very excited to read the next book.  This is the second book in the series.  I really liked this book.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  I was glad to see that"

1,"Keyword:  TUNITY
If you use the app Tunity on your phone to tune into and listen to TV channels on your phone via the Bluetooth speaker in a loud bar, then be ready to be disappointed.  I bought this specifically to listen to Bellator MMA (Spike TV/Paramount) while I was at my local bar.  The bar plays loud music and has tons of TV's.  So I had them put one TV on to the Bellator MMA fights and I used Tunity to play the audio over this BT speaker.  It wasn't loud enough though.  I had to hold the speaker right up to my ear just to hear the announcer on TV calling the fight plays.  So I'm going back to my 10W DIY bluetooth speaker and its heavy batteries instead.  Otherwise, I thought his BT speaker was nice.  It's tuned to play cleanly at full volume.  It just doesn't have ENOUGH volume.  Maybe if there was a button you could press to tune it for vocals only, then it could have played that louder.  Like a quick EQ button.  One EQ setting for music and one EQ setting for vocals only, that could play louder."

1,"As always, I am SMITTEN with Tessa Dare's characters and the situations they find themselves in. If nothing else, the cakes incident would have sealed the deal for how awesome Rafe was. Yet, there was so much more to this big, lovable rake.

Admittedly, I'm a sucker for couples who have to wade through a shared past before they can come to terms with a future. And Rafe? He certainly had some lingering issues about himself and his likability. It took a while before he was convinced Clio really might want him for who he was.

Then there's Clio. She of the eight year engagement. I have to admit I found her family a little unbearable. Not her whole family. Just Daphne and her husband. I totally get why she put up with her sniping and such, but I spent the majority of their interactions waiting for Clio to snap and tell her off. To be fair, Clio's veneer of politeness was mighty thick and I knew it would take a while for her to find the backbone to step up and deal with Daphne. (Also to be fair, Daphne's sniping worked given what we were told about their mother and that her actions were the ones Daphne learned from.)

Meanwhile, Rafe and Clio together made me smile. His roughness against her polite breeding. His kisses....oh, his kisses. I really, REALLY liked those. Not to mention Clio's cake noises. Because a good cake totally deserves cake noises.

1,"This is a great 'how to' book for basic Pro Tools operations. I have it perpetually checked out from my local library.

It is very similar to the Officil ProTools 101 Courseware; in fact, they cover much of the same topics. If you are torn between the two, and you are less technically inclined, then this book is probably your best option. The official ProTools book does some with a nice video and some Plug Ins, but those are mostly available on the DigiDesign website."

Many of his stories are hilarious and I had a hard time putting the book down.  What I found interesting, however, was that there was more to it than just being funny.

1,"It's difficult to open and close the side bags.  It really requires two hands, and when in saddle, that's annoying.  Hopefully we all have horses good enough that you CAN take your hands away from your reins, twist in your saddle, and fiddle with the zipper.  I do, but it's still annoying.

The cantle bag.  I put my oilskin duster (heavy trenchcoat type long jacket, for the men out there who don't know what it is) in the cantle bag, and I could not keep the whole rig right-side up...it kept slipping to one side.  I ended up having to do some serious anchoring to keep it mostly up.  Might be user error, but the next day I just tied my duster on the back of my cantle and left the bag in camp.

It's well-made.  I don't have a complaint about that.  And the pockets are nice & deep.  But I think I'll buy some cheaper ones that are easier to deal with in saddle.
Edit: about 2 years later.  I don't use the cantle bag.  I'm not a hardcore camper or anything like that.  The bags are used every few weekends on a ride (sometimes more).  Still inconvenient to get into in-saddle, but the bags are still in great shape, zippers in great shape. I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars.  I can't quite give it 5 because I can't attest to whether or not the cantle bag is any good."

Anyway, I bought the Aiptek and that's that. It's well worth considering. Just a tip, IMHO.

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback. I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture.

Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot."

1,"I've read a few of the short stories based in the near future where our online lives are run by autos, smart apps designed to make our lives easier. The author creates a plausible and sinister vision of the future which I'd enjoyed. Now all of the stories have been combined into a single book, along with some new stories so I was eager to read through them.

I'll admit that I was tempted to skip through the stories that I'd read previously, but I'm glad that I didn't. The short stories provided different snap shots of the world the author has created and while they were excellwent reads in their own right, they are so much better when re-read with the wider context this book provides.

The overall story is great, the different glimpses tantilise with what is going on before drawing together into a conclusion that both feels logical and satisfies. It's also open to allow further books in the series which I hope is the intent.

As well as providing a good story the author writes well, although in many ways this is a bleak world that he creates it is still full of life and humour. Overall this is a great read that I'm happy to recommend to anyone."

I just didn't care for it as much as the first one."

The outside is a bit thick for my size 4.  The material is soft and comfortable to wear.  I also love the fact that it is a little longer than I expected.  I wear it to keep my hands warm and warm with a good amount of circulation.  I also like that the ring is smaller than I expected.  I also like the fact that it has a little more padding on the inside of my hand.  I'm not a big fan of the padding on the inside, but I don't like the fact that it's less than an inch.  I don't have to worry about the padding going up a bit in the middle of the day, but I do have to be careful of the texture.  I'm not a big guy and I'm not sure what's going on inside the ring.  I don't like that it's a little more than an inch, but I like that it doesn't feel like it's going to get any bigger than I was expecting.  I like the way it's made and the fact that it has a little more padding on the inside.  I think I'll order another pair of these"

I would recommend this belt to anyone who is considering purchasing a long sleeve or very long sleeve.

1,"Ordinary action flicks suffer from the affliction of predictability.  We all know that the gun wielding tough guy will systematically destroy all of his enemies and heroically beat the boss after a more difficult battle at the end.  If you are tired of these kinds of movies, then watch Lucky Number Slevin instead.

What transpires in this movie is completely unpredictable, and it never ceases to be entertaining.  Part of the fun that you have when watching this movie is following the constantly changing and twisting plot.  So I'm not going to ruin any of your viewing pleasure by giving it away.  But I will say it involves the relationship between mob bosses, the stakes of risky gambling, assasins, thugs, and innocent people being caught in the crossfire.  As you can see, it has all of the staples of an action flick.

Superb character development and visual effects make this a must-see action movie with a great plot twist."

1,"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a book for dreamers, lovers and the mommas boy in all of us. I lived at home until I was a vine-ripened 27, so believe me I can relate to James Thurbers Mitty. And Ive always been a fond of a good daydream. Lets see what comes to me now:

Im a powerful land baron with an eye patch. Nay, a feudal samurai lord. No, Im an oil tycoon. Fabulously rich, silver-haired, steely-eyed and whats this? Im in turbulent fight with my lover, no my sister, no my lover and her vengeful son. He has gun. So do I! This tension is terrifying. Daydream continued in the next paragraph.

Where was I? Ah yes, the daydream. Now, Im a young man. A prospector trying to hit it rich. Do I? Yes! This is my daydream, of course Ill hit it rich. Black gold. The farm is saved. I am more lost in this daydream than any I have ever had. Its spellbinding. Its tear-jerking. Spine-tingling. There are plots upon plots upon plots. It twists, it turns. Its a veritable roller coaster ride of goddamn emotion. This is by far the most powerful daydream Ive ever experienced. It feels like an eternity, yet no time has passed. I am exhausted.

And now, I have a confession to make. That was no daydream. That was me experiencing in both words and pharmaceutical hallucinations, the broad plot of my dramatic novel The Spoils of Babylon, set to air on IFC, this very January the 9th, 2014. Adapted, directed, casted and colored in full Breath-Take-o-Scope by yours truly. I do apologize for my surreptitious diatribe, but I must admit, I can scarcely contain my excitement. After more than 40 years and literally thousands of edits (two editors died), the hour is upon us. And it shall be no mere daydream.

Oh, and read The Secret Life of Walter Mitty sometime, its a delight.

Finest regards,

Eric Jonrosh, author, The Soils of Babylon, airing on IFC, January 9th, 2014"
1,They seemed to be of decent quality until I opened the head piece a little too far and the plastic split. I've had them for 1.5 years but I planned on using them a lot longer. I only use them at the office so I expected them to last longer than my apple buds that I've had for 3 years. I wish people would make products that last a reasonable amount of time. It makes me apprehensive to order products from companies I don't know.

1,"I watched it over two or three nights...before I had kids I would probably have just watched it straight through.  It's very well acted (the two leads are just giants) and provides a lot of local flavor; including religious and cultural lore---some of it tough to see.  It is very philosophical for those who haven't read the articles.  It is also gory and dark and shows some things that some people probably don't want or need to see, so not for everyone.  I also liked that the storyline ends at the end of the season; it is what it is with no chance for decline, sell-out, revisionism, inconsistency, et cetera.  I am looking forward to Season 2 and to Matthew McConaughey's next effort."

The story did have some good underlying moral messages and was highly entertaining with all the action.  Wasn't a Jordan fan, but even liked him in this movie.  Love the song, ""I think I can fly"" and  the message of working to make dreams a reality.  And it was just good clean fun to watch.  Hopefully my grandchildren will enjoy it as much as my children did."

1,"We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price."

Of all the places a duchess could give birth to, only Penelope could pull it off. Both Celine/Amy and George had brushes with danger and they always manage to get out unscathed.

With the world becoming more connected because of technology and ease of transportation, the ease of transportation can facilitate the spread of disease on a global unprecedented level. But little has been considered how to use our growing technology to solve global disease outbreaks in a macro sense. How to pay attention to what happens in Hong Kong and make changes at SFO right away to respond to it. It makes sense that currently government officials dub viral/outbreak police training scenarios with 'Zombie' references.

However, I did not realize that everything but the shoe part itself is quilted cloth! I honestly cannot believe it. However, it does say this in the written description.

They do have a rugged sole that is good for walking in all kinds of weather. I have not worn them yet, but I have to say, I cannot personally see how the quilted fabric would be warmer than the material the shoe part is made of.

I guess that's the great thing about listening to your gut and ignoring reviews.... many times people's reading experiences are so personal that it just doesn't pay to read a book based on others' reviews.
This book is basically a collection of different people's life stories. These are people Bronson handpicked to interview, based on how interesting or believable he found their story to be. All of the people interviewed have somehow found a more fulfilling, more rewarding life, but usually not before years of struggle. Many of these stories deal with career, but not all. It becomes apparent that often happiness is a tricky thing, to be found in places where you don't expect it.
One of my favorite stories was the one of the guy who was getting a PhD in English but then ended up becoming a chef. Another one I liked was about the guy who wanted to work in golf. I thought every one of these stories were interesting, and believable.
What I liked the most about this book was its desire to probe life and reality as they are, instead of getting bogged down in neat or too-simple self help explanations or methods. Believe me, I have read a few self-help books during challenging times. Believe me, they did not work. The reason, I think, is because often they provide you with too-ready theories of life instead of encouraging you to think for yourself to find the best solution for yourself. This book doesn't do that. Instead, it makes you realize (at least it made me realize) that achieving contentment is not as simple as we want to think, but it's something that's still possible with a lot of patience, time, and perseverance. (And some luck)."

The blade wiggles so much that I'm afraid the lock may break and there goes my fingers.  I can't suggest this item.  There are better dressing knifes for just $5 more."

My only critique is the plastic iron holder, I would pay a little more for this product for a metal iron holder but this is not enough of an issue to knock a star off.

1,"The best part of this scene is the cannon that swivels on the turret and the Tauntaun.  Let's face it-Tauntauns do not grow on trees in the Lego world and are exclusive to this set.  The fact that it also comes with two Snowtroopers, the Han Solo and two Rebels means 5 minifigs and said Tauntan for $40+ the other portions of the scene.  A pretty good value.  On it's own this scene can clearly shows a solid Hoth scene-but is by no means huge.

As part of a larger Hoth scene, this becomes essential.  I have added it to the Limited Edition Echo Base 7879, Hoth Wampa Cave 8089, Hoth Rebel Base 7666 one additional Echo Base, two Motorized At-At's (10178), other dark gray and white misc pieces AND white dog toy stuffing for quite the display.  All of you may not have these sets but feel free to copy!  Looks amazing but takes up some space.

If you are in to Lego scenes from the original trilogy, this is a must."

1,"I had a windows test server that was crashing every day after I upgraded it from 8gb of memory to 12gb.  I spent over a week online on various IT support forums trying to resolve it.  One day, after running a memory test for 8 hours, the server refused to boot.  After letting it sit for 8 hours, it booted just fine.  I immediately suspected a heat issue.

I purchased these coolers because they were active air movers versus just passive metal coolers. (and the price was right)

They've worked perfectly.  My server has not crashed once since I installed them!!  It runs much faster, and I've not noticed an increase in noise.

Prior to installing them, the chips were extremely hot to the touch after a memory test.  Today with the Air Coolers, they barely luke warm.

They are also extremely easy to install. Once you attach the mounting brackets, they just snap on.

I HIGHLY recommend these Airflow Memory coolers."

1,"Tony Randall stars in WILL SUCCESS SPOIL ROCK HUNTER? opposite Jayne Mansfield. With her hair bleached as white as a Magistrate's wig, Jayne seems a poor Marilyn Monroe caricature whose tendencies to squeak, prance and bubble can be downright annoying.

Example-- Ad man Rock brags about his new business venture: ""That's right Sweetie, I'm president of Rita Marlowe Productions, Inc., but Miss Marlowe is the titular head."" The 'T' word brings a loud squeal from Mansfield that sounds like a bus trying to slow down with no brake pads.

The story opens with great promise-- a demonstration of both Cinemascope and stereo sound. Tony Randall (as himself) stands at extreme stage left and identifies ""the movie you are about to see"" as  THE GIRL CAN'T HELP IT (1956) (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/B000006GF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>&nbsp;(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B00115A4QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>), a previous Jayne effort that starred Tom Ewell. He appeared in '55 with the superior Monroe in another FOX feature, THE SEVEN YEAR ITCH]]  (&nbsp;(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/VHS/dp/6302484405/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">VHS</a>)  (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B000JF5TXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>).

Although Tony is quite good, better in fact than Ewell opposite Monroe, he just can't carry the load with Jayne and her incoherent boyfriend Mickey Hargitay weighing him down. There are however lots of clever bits here: simulated commercial clips, a calypso song and enough bustle and even chaos to hold your attention.

0,"I have owned several lights that have the strobe setting set to a strobe level.  The other two have the dimmer setting.  The light output is not great, but that is not a concern.  The strobe setting is useful if you are working on a lot of lighting.  I have also noticed that the strobe setting is not very bright.  I will probably just go with the dimmer setting if the light output is adequate.

Overall, this light is a great value.  I have a few of these in my home and I have them on a regular basis.  I have used them for a couple of months now and I am very pleased with them.  They are also very bright and not too dim.  I would recommend these lights.  I am using them for a couple of projects and I would recommend them.Works great on my Milwaukee. I have a 6 footer and a"

I had to read the first book in the series, so it was a nice surprise.

The story is a bit slow. I don't think it was intentional. I think it was just because I didn't want to spoil the ending.

It was great to get to know the characters and to see what happened.

I loved the way the story went on. I loved the characters and the way the story moved on.

It was a very enjoyable read. I am looking forward to the next one in the series.

1,"I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.

I would buy this rack again and have recommended it to others who have purchased it and like it also."

1,"One thing I find a bit inconvenient about this food is that I have to have a spoon or fork to get it out of the can with.  That's a trade off, because that means it's not all gravy and the cats get more real food for the catfood buck.  I also have to always chop it up because if I don't, my cats just look at it like ""What is this strange thing, mama?  You expect me to do what- exactly- with this?""

After chopping it up, the cats like it just fine.  I wouldn't say they love it.  They don't dance around when I open the can.  It's almost like they can't really tell what it is right off.  Once they realize it is food, they eat it all readily.

It has agreed well with my oldest, sickly cat.  She has breast cancer and a very sensitive tummy.  She hasn't thrown up eating it and she's been acting like she feels very good.  She's been totally curious about everything I do and very active.

I did feed it to several of the crew though, as a topper, and my youngest kitty - 8 months old- threw up all night the 2nd time he ate it.  The first time, he was fine.  The others were all fine so this might have just been a coincidence."

After one visit to the vet, we were told that Greenies are made predominantly of wheat and that could lead to problems in the later years.  We were giving him at least two a day.  She recommended giving him one maybe every other day or on special occasions.  So the hunt began...

Of all of them, Greenies are his favorites.  They're also the cheapest.

The size of these are a little larger than the Greenies.  They're also pretty cheap on Amazon compared to a local pet store.  They do seem a little tougher than the other dental chews.  All of the other ones seem a bit softer, but these are a bit rough and harder.  One thing that we liked about them is that they are wheat free and gluten free.  Our dog seems to like them.

We try to mix it up and give him different treats throughout the week.  These are a good treat to throw in the mix if you'd like to do that.  They're no Greenies, but if it will keep our little guy healthier a little longer, then we'll continue to give him these and spoil him at the same time."

The only thing that I do not like is that the carpet is very thick. This was a big hit. He also had a lot of fun putting the toys together.  The directions are very simple and you can use different colors or pieces to make a different color. The sound effects are a little loud, but that's fine"
1,"King Hall is the first book in this paranormal romance series. If you like Elementals, vampires, mages and shifters this is the book for you. The four mystical prodigies Ezra, Pearl, Jack and Lily are the future kings and queens and they have some wicked powers. There is action, love, loss and an amazing friendship in this story. I loved the way they bonded always being there for each other no matter what. The story was easy to read. There were some great twists in the story keeping you on edge always wanting to find out what happens next. And Scarlett ends this first book with a great cliffhanger and I hope she doesn't keep us waiting to long for book two. I am definitely looking forward to continuing the story and finding out what happens next."

I wanted her to be able to have some slippers that would stay on her feet (she's almost 2) and that also looked cute. These are perfect because they have a soft sole, which is the best type of shoe for a little walker. She loves wearing them. Even though they are a little big on her, they stay on because of the ankle strap. They are well made, so they will last long, too."

It's very easy to put on and take off and works well.  I use it on my dog who is just 6 months old and it's a little more snug than some other products I've used.  I think it's worth it.  I'm using it for my daughter's puppy.  I've had no problems with her shedding.  It's very absorbent.  My daughter will wear it for a few days before wearing it again.This is my second litter box.  My other one is a bit of a mess and the other one is just too big for my cat's litter box.  I have to replace the old one each time.  The new one is a bit more sturdy and less expensive.

0,"""Back and Back and Back Again,"" the movie's third act, which also features the first two episodes of the movie, is the most solid film in the genre, and it is especially effective with the five-star ratings.  The story is told in a rather simple and almost eerie way, with a great cast of characters and a good story.  The only problem is that the film is very short, with the first half of the film taking up most of the screen time.  The film is shot in a very small window, and the picture quality is quite poor.  There is a scene where a man is walking through the woods, and there is a scene where the sound of the woods is played to a loud and clear volume.  This is a very low-budget film, and it is likely that the story is not as good as the first film.  I don't know why the director was so reluctant to do this film.  The story is based on a true story of a man who, while in the woods with"
0,"A very overlooked action film, it's an interesting look at how people react to the events of the Civil War.  The movie is both emotional and light-hearted.

I'm not sure if it would have had a great soundtrack or just a few crappy songs.  But if you like the old blues movies, this is a must have for your collection.I thought this was going to be one of the best shows ever made.

0,"Insane price. Even at a reasonable price, the box is too large.

The only downside is that the top is a plastic, which is not the plastic of the toy itself. The plastic is a little smaller than the toy itself, but it is still worth it.

Overall, a great product for the money.Very good product. Well made. My daughter has already been playing with this for about 2 months now and is still very happy with it. I am very pleased with this purchase.My 1 yr old grandson absolutely loves this game.  It is just so fun and challenging.  It is definitely a must have for his birthday.This is a great game, but I like that it does not take any game pieces and has only one player.  If you're a fan of the show, then this is probably a good choice.

My only complaint is that the box does not have the right size for the board.  My 6 yr old likes to play with the game pieces.

1,"Ok so the trickiest step was step one.
the hardest step was step four
the most annoying step was assembling the drawers.

They said you would need two people to assemble it but i did it by myself. Let me tell you something, if you are stubborn enough or skilled enough or have the right tools you can do just about anything. I didn't have the right tools so i will let you guys decide on whether i am stuborn or skilled.

Assembly took about 2 hours. The piece, once assembled, is very solid. I expect many many years of use from this. The casters are also very nice too and the whole thing rolls with ease even when you add weight.

Why four stars. Well it is a series of small details. Some of the shelf pin holes are too big and the shelf pins just fall out. One of the door panels was build with the dark color facing out and the other with the dark color facing in. but probably the work part is that some of the pieces are warped. Nothing major but its enough that i can see it and it annoys me."

1,"""Northanger Abbey"" is a wandering book that doesn't really know where it is going.  The first half is typical Austin fare, a heroin at Bath questing for a dear friend and a dearer husband.  The cast of characters is complete; a nutty, vacant aunt,  a dear best friend, a handsome but intolerable man...
Then, it evolves into a biting pastiche of Gothic romance.  It appears a little bit like she got bored with the novel halfway through, and decided to write something more interesting.  The setting changes from society-haunted, frivolous Bath to the dark, shadow-haunted stone walls of Northanger Abbey.
While not as charming as Austin's other books, ""Northanger Abbey"" is enjoyable for all it quirks.  The dialog has that spark of wit necessary for enjoyment, and the writing, while not fully evolved, still evokes the same satisfaction that one gets from later Austin books.
By no means should this be your first Jane Austin novel, but neither should it remain unread."

I wish the little red dot was a little bigger but I'm glad I didn't.My only complaint is that the handle is a little snug. I like the idea of a flat surface to make it easier to see what's going on. For the price, I don't think it's a bad choice. It's not a bad bike"

1,"I was very disappointed to find that there is NO Vimeo app available, as it has been for previous models.

I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.

Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""

Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.

*** three month update ***
Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.

With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.

Rating now downgraded to two stars.

My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony. I've been a die-hard Sony fan since my first spectacular Trinitron TV in the 70's. It's been a sad downhill slide in the past decade, I can see why they are losing mega-bucks."
1,"I've wanted this minifigure for a while, didn't get it because it was a bit expensive.
I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. The colors were not as seen in the pictures. It looks more yellowish that orangish. Which makes it look cheap and more like a knock off.
I tried to fit it in the Lego minifigue dispay case, but it was pretty hard to fit since there is a hose coming from his backpack tank, and the front one is long too.
In conclusion I like this guy, but not a big fan of the color the colors. If I could I would paint it."

I have a pair of these that I wear everyday and they are very comfortable."

I would recommend them for anyone looking for a pair of headphones with great sound. Works great. I did not want the cable to fall out of the charger. I did not want the cable to be bent over and on my head. It's very easy to remove it."

1,"This kit solved my problem of wireless doorbell range issues where you cannot place those wireless kit doorbell buttons outside on your metal framed front door.  Metal doors or door frames block out most of the wireless RF energy radiated from the remote door bell button so many folks complain that the range sucks.  With this kit, you can wire in the transmitter inside your house by your original wired doorbell which will trigger the wireless doorbell when someone presses your old wired doorbell button.  Since the wireless transmitter is now inside your house, you get much better transmit range and you can place your remote wireless doorbell much further away upstairs and it will still be triggered.  So this is a good useful solution kit to get."

It also has a snooze feature that the old one did not have---Ilive in an area that has several power outages a year, and when the power goes off I can look at the clock and can tell exactly when the power went off and can pass that information on to the power company.  I am eighty years old and have owned several clocks that I found impossible to operate,and this model is perfect for my needs.  If I need it I USE my cellphone as a backup----A great product-----"

1,"If I had not watched youtube videos, replacing the bandsaw tires would have been impossible.  I was dreading the job, but following the suggestions: clamps, bicycle tire levers, soaking in hot water made it a piece of cake.  I didn't even remove the wheels from my old 12"" Craftsman saw!  And the Zoopolr tire levers and worth every penny of the $10.00. Start by clamping the tire in 3 places, then start ""inching"" the tire onto the wheel using the tire irons.  Suddenly you are able to take a larger ""bite"", and presto the tire is on."

Weighs just under 1/4 pound and we love it. The attachments are very easy to use and it is easy to clean."
1,"Just finishing this up. If you're a Pistols or PiL fan there's plenty of good stuff in here for you. It's long, but never boring (to me anyway) and quite thorough. John gives a lot of details about PiL and the creation of the early records that was quite interesting. From the title, you might think it's a negative screed about how pissed off Lydon is about everything, not so. Buy it."
1,"Very Tarantino style film.  Entertaining, funny and keeps you paying attention.  Hated to see one character get bumped off, but the one who got it deserved it... Highly recommended."
1,"On the off chance that like me you've read Big Chief Elizabeth and Samurai William (or at least one of them), it may be worth me stating that in my opinion this is the least impressive of the three. In agreement with the review below, Nathaniel's 'story occupies only a small part of this book', and it remains a trifle unconvincing that his 'endeavours were pivotal in the course of history'.

That being said, there are all the usual details - from tragic biographies to prolonged and agonising torture - to keep you turning the pages, and it is certainly interesting to read once again about how horrible those Dutch were to the poor English (as can also be read about in Samurai William). Then, of course, Milton is great at weaving a yarn together, and it is always fascinating to read about the exploits of various larger-than-life adventures; particularly those exploits centred on parts other than the 'spiceries' themselves. The book is a light and enjoyable read, but it is most certainly worth a read. Milton's greatest contribution to history is, I feel, his abilities to take a reader's imagination so convincingly back to a time of pirates and uncharted adventure."

He's a huge fan of the military-style tactical gear and so I ordered this for my grandson."
1,"I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

I was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion. I ALWAYS pretest every product prior to writing a review. I am free to write whatever I believe to be true, whether positive or negative. This is my true story and my honest opinion."
1,"This book lays out the attacks on the Clinton in full detail. While you could probably guess the things done by Falwell, Starr and the unrepentant segregationists in Arkansas; it was illuminating to see the machinations of Tripp, Isikoff and others I never could have named before this book.

The many 4-5 star reviews tell a lot but the one star reviews are also illuminating. None of those come from people who appear to have read the book. In a just world, they would have to and, if they still were unmoved, they would have to fact check every detail."

If you are looking for a regular monopoly game, this is not it. You can play it like a regular game,  but that is not the intended purpose, so I would rather have the original version if I wasn't going to personalize.  I think this is a perfect gift for the one person that loves Monopoly.  We own the dot com version, spiderman, electronic, regular etc.

My boys have already personalized the cards.  Their dad is very kind and sweet and always jokes that he will ""drop the hammer"" if they don't stop whatever it is they are doing...The boys made him a card that says dad dropped the hammer, go directly to jail.  That is just one example of the personalization of cards.

See the video for the inside of the box, as well as the pieces. I thought this would help so you could see exactly how you personalize it.

Pros: Fun twist on Monopoly

Cons: Not great if you don't want to personalize.  I don't like the four folding board.  They always break! No small labels for the properties or the corresponding pieces on the board.

I was not initially that excited for this game, and once I saw exactly how you personalize it, I am really excited to complete the personalization and give it to my husband for his birthday!"

I love that it has a 1/2 inch chuck too since I don't own any reduced shank bits.

This drill packs plenty of power and has good runtime.

The handle is thicker than the 18v stuff because the battery slides into it. It doesn't bother me, but it isn't the most comfortable.

The light isn't in the best place either due to the battery design and casts a shadow."

The new model is more quiet than the old one."
1,"This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!  I received this nonslip towel set at a discount in exchange for my completely unbiased and honest opinion of it."

1,"I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.

G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:

G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts.
A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts
An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts
A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts
A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.

Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage."

1,"I have been on Eugene Peterson kick recently. The more books that I read from him, the more I am drawn to his writing. He is wise, earthy, and poetic, a wonderful combination. Reversed Thunder: The Revelation of John and the Praying Imagination (1988) was the most recent.

In Reversed Thunder, Peterson explores the creative and imaginative language of St. John in the last book of the Bible. In my experience, many books about the Revelation of John attempt to provide a key to the events of the book as a type of apocalyptic road map. In other words, many books claim to have found the key to the end times and are eager to share their findings. This book is refreshingly different.

In the introduction, Peterson wrote, ""I do not read the Revelation to get additional information about the life of faith in Christ. I have read it all before in law and prophet, in gospel and epistle. Everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the previous 65 books of the Bible...I read the Revelation not to get more information, but to revive imagination."" Later: "" I have taken the position that this book does not primarily call for decipherment, as if it were written in code, but that it evokes wonder, releasing metaphors that resonate meanings and refract insights in the praying imagination.""

To be honest, this is the first thing I have read about the book of Revelation that I have actually benefited from, actually enjoyed. Peterson, a poet in his own write, writing about the poetry of St John is a lovely gift. If you are someone who has been confused by the book of Revelation, I would commend Reversed Thunder to you.  It is well worth the time."

1,"We received a early copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.

Talon and Gretchen's book was a wonderful read. The characters are well thought out and all blend together to form a great story. I didn't read the first book in this series but it definitely wasn't necessary to this story. Gretchen travels back to her hometown to try to figure out what has happened with her father. While there, she meets Talon and the sparks fly from there. I would recommend this book to those that like reading a paranormal/shifter type series with familiar characters but who also like books that you don't have to necessarily read in order. I will definitely be looking for future books from this author.

1,"The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

Andrei in the other hand had always live in the middle of the violence and dangerous situations working for the Russian Mafia, but there was something that make him help Cassie.

The plot and storyline are well-written. The story is fast-paced, action packed, intriguing and captivating. The rest of characters were likeable, and memorable.

This is a great read and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good Mafia/ Organized Crime Genre. Sold to the Hitman is an absolute wild ride. Alexis Abbott ha become one of my favourite authors. I've been following her since her very first Mafia/Organized Crime series, and will continue to do so.

1,"I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

1,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."

Again, the sign of a good read is wishing for the story to continue on."

1,"This is the first camera case I have ever bought so I don't have anything to compare it to.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.

The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?

I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.

Overall a good, well-made case that will last for a long time."

1,"I use this with the larger size bowl, but the smaller one makes a nice extra cup for my purse or glove department. With the bottle, it does bounce on my leg while walking, but not enough that I notice it. It's really nice to use on a walk.

06/15/15 I'm changing my rating from five stars to three because the water bottle now falls out of the loop. I guess I've used it enough that the hole has stretched and it bounces enough that the water bottle works its way out of the holder and falls. I've tried just taking a half full bottle, and it still falls out. This started out really nice, but now won't work for me.

Maybe if attached to something that doesn't bounce as much, such as a knapsack, it would still work fine. But I only use a fanny pack when walking my dog, so it's attached to that."

1,"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old loves it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for as long as we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for as long as we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his legs go thru, and sometimes even leans backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toys to the sides where the canopy snaps on/off. He really loves the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hands to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!"

1,"Very disappointed for three reasons. 1) A small atomic weapon is required to open the packaging.  2) The hose is very stiff.  That makes the hand-held part difficult to maneuver and also transmits motion to the  head bracket.  And 3) the hose connectors are absolutely smooth and thus impossible to tighten by hand.  And the use of any tool will mar the finish.  At least one other model apparently has ""ridged connectors"" because the directions which came with mine refers to them.

I wonder if it was not Water Pik's intention to punish me for buying an inexpensive model?

From what I saw in the store (mine was not purchased from Amazon) the packaging is such that you cannot see the hose and connector type until you have purchased the thing and somehow have managed to open it."
1,"This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing....."
0,"Works much better than expected.  I love the feel of the buckle.  The buckles are sturdy and well made.  I am very happy with the purchase.This is a great gift. It is great for anyone looking for a multi-tool. This is a great tool for the money. It is very easy to use and holds the item very well. I wish I could have bought a different item with the same price.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones.  You can change the strap length, but it is not necessary.  I'm glad I found this.I have used this for a couple of months now.  It is very easy to use and to set up.  It is very quiet.  I have had no problems with the rain fly catching the rain from my car.  I would recommend this to anyone looking to fly"

1,This movie was so stupid. The only good thing about this movie was Stuart Townsend but even he couldn't save this movie from getting more than one star from me. What were they thinking when they released this pile of trash?!
1,"I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price."

1,"I have used this watch for a little less than a year now and find it loses about five seconds every couple of weeks.  Since I run on a ""by the second"" schedule, it is important for me to know the correct time to the second.  However, I am adaptable and will set my watch about five seconds ahead and over the course of the week I know it will catch up.  It is easy to set the time and only takes a moment to reset.  I drive at night and the light is still working on the watch.  I had an atomic watch which kept perfect time but the light kept eating up the battery and was worthless driving at night.

Easy to read numerals, good light, lightweight, and had it kept better time I would have given it five stars."

1,"My son is pretty obsessed with Blaze and the Monster Machines and unfortunately the only character we can seem to find literally anywhere is the original Blaze. So naturally, all the other characters we have to order online. Every time we think we have them all, they come out with new characters or variations of the main characters. Luckily, we have all the main characters now. These are not cheap knock off versions of the Nick Jr characters, they are the same ones you find at toy stores or big box stores. They are heavy duty, well made die cast trucks that have held up to my three year olds heavy playing and smashing them together and off of other things."

0,"""Don't be a-feared.""  Even though it's an interesting subject matter, it's not a documentary.  It's not a film for the younger generation, or for those who are in the middle of a career in the movie business.  If you are a teenager, you probably don't know what a documentary is or what the genre is.  There's a lot of nudity, sex, and violence in the movie, and there's an interesting story line that moves along very slowly.  The director is very young, and he has a lot of time on his hands.  This movie is a movie that is a work of art, and it's not for the children.  The reason I like this movie is because it has a lot of nudity and sex in it, and it's a very interesting subject matter.  I really liked the ending of the movie, and I think that was the best ending I have seen in a long time.  It was a really moving movie, and I think that the director's heart was very clear.

1,"Our Vet recommended these Pill Pockets for our 4 kittens when we switched from using a topical flea medication to a pill form.  When we got home, I placed my order and I was excited to see how this would work!  When this product was delivered, I quickly tore open the package to see what it looks like and exactly how it smells.  Well, I was bummed when all the pill pockets were smashed together instead of being individually separated into a pill pocket form.  However, I did make it work by tearing off a piece, rolling it into a ball and then I placed the pill inside of the ball I made.  I would have returned it but, I did not want to wait any longer since the kittens were overdue on this medication. As for how it smells, it really does not smell like a Salmon flavor to me anyways.

Out of the 4 kittens, 3 loved the pill pockets and wanted more!  Each kitten had their own pill because of their weight so, I kept them separated.  My first kitten, loved the pill pocket, she swallowed it with the pill included.  I was very happy and thought this would be a breeze! Not so much, LOL!  The second kitten ate the pill pocket but, he spit out the pill so, I tried it again and the same thing happened.  The exact same thing happened with the third kitten! When I got to the fourth kitten, she ran away after taking one sniff of the pill pocket.

So, 3 kittens out of 4 love the pill pocket taste but, where smart enough to know that there was a pill inside. Needless to say, it was a very funny experience!  Not to mention what it took us to finally get them to take their pill!"

Great characters people the book,  the writing is terrific, the (...) scenes are tastefully done, and the adventure is a grand one.

Don't buy the ones without memory unless you want to have the same lighting effect all the time, or go out each night and change them, to what you want. These remotes do not have

1,"Toby, our 90-lb ""pup"", got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own.  The Petstep saved the day.  Easy to deploy, easy to fold and stow.  You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use.  By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds, and stow it in about 10 seconds.

From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.  The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I'm sure we'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own.  But she's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think."

I would like to finally see this Story told as it was. Technicolor and Beautiful Costumes.

1,"This was a good plot and I really enjoyed the beginning of the book as the plot began to unfold. A young 24year old girl, her mother has died leaving her to bring up her younger brother and sister. She finally begins her dreams of studying which will hopefully lead to fulfilment of dreams in the business world when she has an on and off attraction to her university professor.

It seems the young lady makes lots of assumptions along the way and it is a little difficult to understand how she comes to fall in love with the professor considering she spends so much time full of unwarranted anger with him. He on the other hand is like a typical male, thinking he is being considerate and all the time pushing all the wrong buttons. Except the right buttons that lead to an apparent pregnancy.

I shan't ruin the rest of the story. The book is well written, I think it would be nice if the heroin role was not filled with so much anger and assumptions, which leads the reader to feel there is a lot of 'love' that seems to be missing from this love story, however somehow it finds its natural ending. I would encourage the writer to write more as her style of writing is definitely very good and I did enjoy the opportunity to read this book. I would read her work again!"

1,This clock is a really fun idea. The numbers do show up on the wall or ceiling as advertised. The color matched exactly as it shows. I think the most surprising thing about this clock was the fact that the protection only stays on for a short period of time. Perhaps even only 60 seconds then shuts off. Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well. Otherwise my 10 year old daughter really does enjoy the clock. She was extremely excited about it and I wouldn't say any of the features really disappointed her.

1,"Cowboys is a stand alone from the rest of the books. I'll just say this topic isn't my cup of tea but the stories were a little better fleshed out than some I've read with at least some personal background on the characters and a little plot. Another good part was that each one can stand alone but except for the first one they continue with some of the same characters and main location of The Key Club. There must be another book that follows or another set since I was left wondering about The Key Club owner and whether she ever finds her match. I also found myself invested quickly in several of the female characters and how they deal or dealt with past issues or tramas but like I said the whole mnage thing is not my cup of tea or any party of my personality fantasies but interesting, I guess, to read about.  Some very sexy guys that really put a woman's needs first can be a huge turn on!"
1,"For this to be a short I am blown away. I would have never expected the story that was presented. Although this book can be read as a stand alone  I think it is better to read the series in order so you get a better understanding of Thorn. Some secrets would be ruined but nothing ground breaking of you don't though.

As for the story in itself. I would have never expected Thorn's past, aside from what we know, to be this. It's exciting, chilling, crazy and on some level could be a true story. Although I am happy with the ending even with all it's twist and turns the ending between Simone and Thorn is a little rushed. I bet we will hear more from them though as Kiki's story is next."

1,"This toy was given to my daughter when she turned one -- now she's 18 months old and still loves it. It's amazing to see how the repetition of putting the blocks in the top of the giraffe and watching them come out of the trap door down below can bring hours of entertainment to little ones. The cute sounds that it makes are an added bonus!  For hand-eye coordination, this is a must. This has gone from a sitting down, stacking blocks and giggling toy to becoming a purse for my daughter. She loves the handle on it and thinks it's perfect to tote other objects in around the house."

1,"At 100 pages long, ""Cowboy Crazy"" relied on some trope (including a corny one) to move the plot along, but it was an enjoyable one.

Hank Dalton received an ultimatum... Get married to inherit part of the family ranch... Or get left with nothing. Hank, the oldest, loved to run the ranch, but living two hours from civilization limits his choice of women. When his four brothers left for the city to pick up some girls, he chose to stay home... and got to rescue a stranded motorist... Charlotte Halton. Charlie was almost killed when her crazy BF drugged her and burned her apartment down, leaving her scarred both inside and out. She decided for a fresh start... and getting stranded in Paradise Valley in the middle of cattle country wasn't part of her plan... but it just may be Hank's luck. Hank knew it was fate that delivered a woman to him, but she's skittish. Can Hank help her find a new start? Or will she run away again?

I personally don't like ""run away to sort my feeling"" endings, but there's a grand gesture to mitigate that, so at least that's good."

1,"Love this!  Let me share the best two recipes ive found to make, the first one makes a 2 lbs loaf and the whole wheat a 1.5 one.
French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

both these use oil which i find much easier that cutting up butter and no dry milk or molasses needed or other ingredients I might not have on hand needed."

0,"Love, love, love. As some reviewers have mentioned, the finish is a bit on the thin side, and the bottom is not very smooth. The bottom is also slightly sticky, so it is not a big deal. The outside is a bit rough. I was worried it would be rough, but it's not. I will probably get a different color and finish. I love this product. It does what it's supposed to do. It's easy to clean, and I don't have to worry about the coffee getting stuck in the bottom of my cup, or anything. I've found that it is a bit difficult to clean because of the plastic coating. I'll be returning it. The color is true to the picture. It's not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but it's not as bad as I expected. I love it. Works great. Easy to use.

1,"Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products."
1,"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.

Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper. By the end of the third book I had more than 100 bookmarks."

1,"This was a very captivating and enjoyable novel.  Young takes us back to Old Town and Haymakers for one exciting and emotionally provocative tale.  Her vivid descriptions and down to earth storytelling transported me to Jersey alongside the characters.

Youngs writing style makes you feel like you're sitting beside the characters listening to the story instead of reading it.  This up close and personal approach really drew me in until I couldn't put the book down.  I really, really enjoyed getting to know Harley better.  Weve met her throughout the series but getting up close and personal with her makes it so much more real.  I feel like I understand Harley now.  Seeing what she thinks and learning her history makes her more real, rather than just the catty girl weve come to know.  Getting a glimpse into Jakes mind is also quite revealing.  I may think his rationale is completely skewed but I understand (and like) him so much better now.  The contrast between the way the two main characters see themselves as compared to how they see each other definitely adds to the story.

As a whole, this was a fantastic novel that wrapped up this series nicely.  Im definitely sad to have hit the end of the Wilde brothers saga, but it was a fantastic journey while it lasted.

Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review."

1,"Original headphones, left channel went dead within first two months. Company replaced them immediately. Replacement set lasted about 10 months when the plastic piece connecting the bracket to the ear piece just broke.  Exploded right off my head!  Fixed it with superglue. Two months later the exact same thing happened to the other ear piece.  Was watching a movie when they just fell off my head.  I was so mad I emailed their sales department complaining about their junk headphones.  They wanted the serial number and then requested that I send them back for a replacement.  That was four years ago. The ear pads have since flaked and disintegrated and those were replaced about three months ago.  Two nights ago, while watching a movie, they just exploded right off my head, the plastic piece connecting the ear piece to the head brace just broke.  I have finally trashed these head phones.  If you want a great set of headphones and are willing to pay $150, get the Sennheiser HD595.  Not only do they sound superior to the Bose Triports but they are made like a quality product should be."

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an old-fashioned adventure movie.  It is a must see for any movie lover.I didn't think this was going to be a great movie.  I was expecting more.  I expected a good, thoughtful story that could have been told about a very interesting subject.  I'm not sure why I was so disappointed.  The acting was okay, but the story was not convincing.  The movie had a lot of clichs and was a bit too ""raw"".  I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a good story, but this movie didn't seem to be that bad.  I don't really know what the problem was with the movie.  I was hoping to see more of the ""real"" version of the movie.  I guess it was supposed to be a story about a real person.  It seemed like it was going to be about a couple of men who get into a gang of robbers in a beautiful city.  It was a bit cheesy at times but it was a good story that could have been told about a guy who is a pretty good actor."

1,"419 is most certainly for the patient reader who prefer complexity and depth of plot and character to action.  I found it compelling because there was a lot to think about.  I imagine most of us who are more amused than confused by the many Nigerian scams especially appreciated that subplot.  I truly admired the author for the skillful and purposefully methodical steps ultimately leading up to the grand finale.  Laura did strain my ability to believe a bit, but she still was basically an effective character.

Action fans may well skip this one, but those of us wanting literature that's meaningful will cherish this volume."
1,"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

I will likely not buy again, might see what Giro has to offer (since I like their Zero gloves for the summer)."

Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!"
1,"DFW deserves a better biographer ... this book reads like a very long Wikipedia article.  I applaud Max for doing original research (interviews, etc.) and roughly half of the information in this book was new to me, but I feel like he should have spent way more time actually WRITING a biography rather than collating a bunch of letters and interviews without really analyzing his subject.  I never get the sense that the author is anything more than a mediocre journalist, or a member of a particularly active DFW list-serv who decided that he wanted to write a book---except that he didn't actually know anything about writing biographies."

1,"Update:  I received the 600 Professional today.  First off,  this filter is very large.  It completely dwarfs both my Fluval 305 and
Marineland 350 Magnum.

I also notice that like my Fluval 305,  the Hydor is manufactured in Italy.  Something I find interesting,  given all of the aquarium
filters that are made in China.

The 600 PRO is well  constructed,  with five media baskets:  two for mechanical filtration and three for biological filtration.

The motor housing for this filter is solid and well designed, and the motor itself  is completely silent.

The motor head is secured to the 600 PRO's canister  with front and back clamps, as well as side levers which offer
a tighter seal.

Even the media trays have nice adjustable plastic straps which allow for easy removal of media, and the trays themselves fit snugly into the 600 PRO's chassis, stacked atop one another.

Aesthetically,  the entire  Hydor Professional series has a refreshingly industrial look,  which exudes quality.

The fact that this filter was discounted by about $80 from its list price only makes the aforesaid that much better.

If the Hydor 600 PRO stands up as well as my Fluval 305 and  Eheim Classic filters have, I will consider this to be money well spent.

Highly recommended!

I have been considering purchasing one of these filters since they came out.  However, they were selling at list price for quite awhile.
So I decided to wait  until the prices became more reasonable.  I just found a brand new 600 for sale on Amazon for about $150, so I decided to purchase it.  Will update my experiences.  Based on what I have read about these filters thus far, I've left four stars.

This is the largest canister filter I have ever purchased.  I also own a Marineland Magnum 350 and a pair of Fluval 305s (350 GPH VS 260 GPH respectively), so at 345 GPH this will be about as large as the Magnum 350, even though the 600 dwarfs the 350 in size."

1,"I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself."

1,"I purchased this light when it was on sale for $29.00 and I wish I had ordered more because I love it and all my friends love it. When it goes on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door.
Update!
 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors."
1,"This Rice Cooker cannot be stopped! I've been using it for over a year and decided to write a review because of all the negative reviews here. For the water bubbling over issue, rinse your brown rice if you don't want it to bubble over. It's more starchy, and it usually says to do so on the package! Also, I've never had an issue with the lid catch not once. Maybe there's some brutes out there that aren't able to care for their appliances. My Zojirushi hasn't had any issues with dependability. Makes rice perfect every time once you get the water amount for your particular rice right. Which is true of any rice cooker. Very simple to use. Two modes, cook, and warm. If you can't operate this unit you shouldn't be allowed in a kitchen because you may hurt someone."
1,"Bought this for my 2003 accord. Although the rack is not ment to fit an accord, it will. I don't think it will fit 3 bikes, but it will fit 2 on the back of the car.

1,"This is a fantastic backpack. Very stylish. Plenty of room. The zippers are good, but the ones for the laptop go too far down, into the side pouches, so they're hard to get at sometimes. It's a minor thing, but Thule could improve this, I think. Also, the hard case is HARD, and, it causes the shell to collapse. Some kind of ribbing in that area to keep the shell out, and prevent it from caving inwards might be a good idea."

1,"I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to."

I had to get a replacement train, the Trolley Train, and it's still going strong. It's a great toy for a little kid and is still fun to play with.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is a little rough. I wish I would have gotten it a little better for my son. He loves it, so I gave it a 4 star because I think it is a little rough.This is a great game for a great price.  It is easy to learn and it has lots of great cards to play with.

0,"Draupadi is one of the few writers I've ever read who does not make a mockery of the stereotype that so many people in the world are lazy and have no money.  In his latest novel, ""The Giver"", which is set in the American south, he gives us the first of a series of scenarios where the most successful non-white person on the planet is a great socialite.  This is not a caricature of the social status of the average American, as many Americans are naturally drawn to be socially intelligent, but rather, a caricature of the social status of the average American.  So we learn that the giver, Joe, has been driven to a new town by the poverty of the region, and has no friends or family who will let him move on to a new home.  The novel is very clever, with Joe engaging in a very interesting discussion of what it means to be a ""socialite"".  He is also a good storyteller.  So, there is no other way to describe the book than that it is a well written novel.

""The Giver"" is a very interesting novel, and one I recommend reading for anyone who wants to know more about the social status of the average American.  I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in the social status of the average American.  But, I think it is a very well written novel.  It is a very well written novel, and one that should be read by anyone who wants to know more about the social status"

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the decade, and the characters are well developed.

But he is not.  He is a man who is not his father, but is the son of a man who is not his father."

Anyone  interested in the evolution of life will also find a lode here.

1,"Ive decided to retire to Marietta and get a permanent ringside seat to all the excitement that seems to grace this little enchanting town. Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.

The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.

Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?

Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.

Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories.

1,"I upgraded my desktop computer because the video card I was using was considerably outdated, and I couldn't even burn DVDs because it was so old. I wanted something inexpensive, but powerful enough to run most video applications. This card integrated perfectly with my computer, even though I only have a X-press 1.0 slot instead of a 2.0. I tested it on YouTube with an HD (1080) video running full resolution and full-screen the quality was flawless; the only lag and jitter was from my Internet connection. The GPU even works with BOINC and helps my computer crunch data. A great card for a wonderful price."

1,"I've enjoyed all the Sookie Stackhouse novels.  This one is an adreneline rush.  I promised myself I'd read just a chapter or two a day, to savor what I knew would be a staggeringly good thrill ride.

The twists and turns and revelations got the better of me, I finished the book the second day.  I love how Sookie is a pawn and yet, so much more self-possessed and in control in this novel than previous ones.  The series reminds me, the only thing you can count on is change, and the best we can all do is adapt.  Sookie Stackhouse, I hope you live forever!"

My cats however will not have anything to do with anywater with this in it. My cat become very obsessed about the faucet very time I wash my hand. They think it's the only source to the water after I put this thing in their drinking water. Tip to pug owner, pug sometimes stink and it's not their breath, it's the stuff stuck under their folded skin so please clean their face more often.

My main concern is scratching the lens, even using the softest cloths that came with my prescription glasses seem to scratch the lens after awhile. Wish they would use a scratch proof coating as the do with my regular glasses, but than that would increase the price. I guess if I get a year out of these I can afford another pair next year at this price."
0,"If your desire is to use an electric drill, you may need to make a small hole in the bottom of the drill to get a solid surface to hold the drill in place. This is common in small drill bits.

I used a drill press with an adapter and a lot of pressure to hold the drill in place. I did not use the standard drill press so I could not test the impact. I tried to push the drill on the impact with a flat surface so that the impact would not get in the way. The impact does not move and it does not feel like a drill press. I am happy with the results.

1,"Just finished reading Primacy of Darkness (Brooklyn Shadows Book 3) by Brock Deskins. This was a wild ride from Book 1 throughout and ending with Book 3. I must say this was my favorite of the 3. The first 2 Books set us up for the climatic energy in Book 3. I really liked that all the characters from previous books play a continued part in the ending of this Trilogy. Incredibly imagined, yet believable character. Imagine if you will,  Jack the Ripper returning to modern times as a vampire in Brooklyn, New York! If you cannot make that leap let Brock make it for you and take this journey along with Leo, Kat, Marvin, Vincent, Trinh, Carol and a motley crew of vampires, werewolves, bloodlings and humans good and evil on this amazing adventure. I look forward to reading much more of Brocks work in the future.

Synopsis (from back cover): Jack the Ripper, sadistic madman of old London, once thought long dead, has returned to New York in an effort to quench his thirst for blood and mayhem. When the city's vampire enclave finds itself insufficient to deal with a madman of Jack's caliber, Vincent, the enclave head, enlists Leo Malone to put the maniac down before he reveals the existence of vampires as he throws the city into the throes of chaos and terror. Leo soon finds that Jack is not the only monster with which he must contend. A ghost from his past has also seemingly crawled from its grave and seeks to put an end to him and the rest of his kind."

1,"So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well."
1,"I was bitten by the Spyder years ago, and have learned one valuable thing. If I see a Spyderco I like, I jump on it immediately, as the company discontinues models all of the time. Often, a model will return briefly in a limited edition ""sprint run"", and those generally sell out quickly because of a wide collector base.

This model is small, tough, and insanely sharp. At this price, if you've considered collecting, this one is a good start. Legendary quality on a knife that may or may not be around for long."

I also was able to cut a nice small length for my headphones that I carry in my purse.  Haven't tried them on larger cable yet but found the Velcro strength more than adequate.  Would definitely purchase again and highly recommend this product.

0,"Maybe if you have a dog with a wide mouth you might need to make a small change. I think it's a good idea to have some guidelines when it comes to how much food you should give your dog. Some people think it's ok to give some food to your dog and others say it's ok to give them a treat. If you have a dog with a long mouth or a sensitive stomach, I think that's fine. If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit. I've found that having a dog with a sensitive stomach is not as important to your dog as having a hard body and to a dog that is sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest. My dog also likes some of the soft treats she gets but she doesn't like the soft ones."

1,"Well, this one was very short. To the point I was in no way ready for it to end. I just wanted it to keep going, to see what happened to Emily & Michael, because dayam is the reader left hanging at the end.

If this novella (or short, I guess) is a ploy to get readers to need to read on in the series, then congratulations, because the author has succeeded. This is definitely a great introduction to some of the character's in Kemmerer's Elemental world. I liked the two main character's a LOT. The writing has an easy simplicity to it that helps with the cadence of reading. It's full of conflict-romance, too, but without being overly mushy, which can sometimes happen in YA.

Though I'm left with quite a lot of questions: how their `powers' work because that isn't fully explained; the why and wherefore of it all isn't in here; I'm left unsure whether or not regular humans exist around these `special' folk, or of the hierarchical structure of it all and why certain families are expected to obey the requests of others/or stick to agreements made with them; there is evidently some kind of societal ladder and which rungs people belong on is obviously an important part of the world created here ...

So, yeah ... lots of questions. All of which I want answered. So I shall most definitely be reading on."

What is horrible though is the too shorter handle.  What do they think all people are between 3 and 4 feet tall with very long arms.?
Ridiculous and weak telescoping handle but as I said this will not be used often.
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT as it is only fairly well made and though spacious for a small animal has no real substantial comfort to the included comfort pad and is somewhat cheaply made.

0,I've read a lot of books by the author and this one is by far my favorite.  The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the author is very clear that it's a little different in the way she chooses to deal with her own issues.  The book is a bit slow at times and it's a bit hard to follow at times as you're trying to figure out who the main character is and who they are.  It's very refreshing to have a book that is written in the style of a book that is written with a great feel for a story.  I especially like the way the author describes the characters and the theme of the story.  I really liked the way the author gave us an idea of who the main character was and what her feelings were about the world.  I really liked the way she took the reader
1,"I am probably not the best person to write a review for this book. I love this series when it first came out, and now with each book I just get more and more disappointed. This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance. The sex was typical for these types of manlove books. I was just annoy cause it didn't connect or update on any of the other books in the series. Really this is not a series!!!! These should all just be stand alone books."

The epson jas three mount hiles which requires one of the arms to be rotated away only using 3 arms like a triangle bit even so it is pretty sturdy.  I would recommend using some locktite on the screws or hiding the cables begind a vertical conduit or cable hider though.  Bumping the wires can cause it to shift a bit.  That said, it is a simple fix.  I am very happy with it overall."

1,"I enjoyed this story. Hud and Mack are great! It is the third book in the series but can be read by itself (or first) without any problem whatsoever. It's a little sweeter than the other two. The sex is still explicit and fairly frequent but just the overall tone was sweeter for me, in a good way, than the other two. Mack and Hud still have some sarcasm that go back and forth but Hud is just such a sweet guy. Hud has been playing football for 10 years and so is more mature and is ready for something else in his personal life. I loved Hud and Macks interactions together and the building of their relationship. It was genuine and believable for me. Nothing was rushed or forced. I was able to just dive in and stay there until I reached the end. In this book, Hud's football has reached the playoffs and so they are dealing with their relationship, who they are to the team, and the extra pressure from wanting to win the championship. I loved how the football and romance were mixed together. It was a great blend and I felt like I got enough of both, rather than feeling like I was missing something somewhere. I really enjoyed the characters and this story.

1,"The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to."

1,"These made my dog sick. The other night she was vomiting all night long and had terrible diarrhea. The poor girl was so nauseated that she was dry heaving after completely emptying her stomach. It went on and on for hours. She basically was suffering the same symptoms that humans do when they have a very bad case of food poisoning, complete with chills and shivering, very sore abdominal muscles, weakness and dehydration. It was just awful for her. In the morning, of course, we rushed her to the vet. That was Saturday morning and now it's the wee hours of Monday (I can't sleep) and she's still at the animal hospital having IV fluids, anti-emetics and antibiotics. The vet hopes she can come home later today, but it might not be until tomorrow. The ONLY thing my dogs ate that was new and different in the last several days were these T-Bonz. They each got 2 as a treat. I didn't think the treats had anything to do with it until my other dog had diarrhea and threw-up a bit that morning before we went to the vet. Thankfully he only vomited once and only had a bit of diarrhea and soft stools a couple of times. My pup that got sick had a splenectomy last year, so I'm thinking that whatever was in these treats that made them sick, her body just had a much harder time fighting it off than his. I strongly recommend you NOT give your dog these treats unless you're willing to risk a hefty vet bill, a very sick and completely miserable dog, along with a miserable family, themselves all sick with worry. (Also, just in case it helps anyone or helps add some perspective and clarity: my dog that got very sick is a 20lb schnauzer female, 10 years-old. The dog with a bit stronger stomach is a cocker spaniel-mix male that's 37lbs and he's roughly 10 years-old, give-or-take a couple of years."

The others on the trip had to go replinish they're ice on day two and my ice was practically unmelted .I did get ice on day three but only because others had went back to town .I think i could have made it without it through day four without refreezing the packs. I definately reccomend purchasing these especially if you plan on being somewhere where ice is a commodity.

1,"I really enjoy novels involving angels and demons so this was a given for me, especially considering it was published by Random House Flirt, which is quickly becoming one of my favorite publishing imprints. This novels plot kept me thoroughly engaged with its battle between good and evil. Sophia St. James moves to a small town in Connecticut, never expecting to see Guardian Angels in spirit form. In fact, she is the only one who can.
Sophia was a great character. She was strong and brave and I loved her narration. Michael was the angel. He was moody, protective, and volatile. It was really hard to figure out what he was feeling, but I loved his character nonetheless. He had good intentions. Dante was the Demon Knight who was convinced that the reincarnated soul of his lost lover was in Sophia. He was one of those evil characters you couldn't help but somewhat enjoy because of their passion for whatever they are doing. Regardless, I am definitely Team Michael. This novel had the typical love triangle (good boy, bad boy, and the girl stuck between) but it had a unique spin on it that prevented it from becoming a trope.
Forbidden was a thrilling and thoroughly entertaining novel about an angel, and demon, and the girl who cant figure out who she wants. I cant wait to get my hands on the second book, Awaken, because I am sure that Lori Adams will continue to write a great story."

I liked the ending, but I did not like the fact that it ended a little abruptly. I would have liked to see more of the relationship between the two main characters. Overall, it was a good read and a short story. It was a good read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing. I don't think I've read a book that has a relationship between the two main characters, but I did find that I could relate to both of them. I was just not very happy with the way the book ended. It felt like the main character was trying to make her way back to her life, and the story ended abruptly. I was hoping that the author would have a more happy ending, but I didn't feel it. I felt like the book was rushed and I had a hard time getting through it. It felt like it was rushed and just a lot of time was spent on the book."

It's a little pricey for what it is, but it's not bad.  I'm not a fan of plushie dolls, but this one is a little better than I expected.  This one is a little bigger than I thought it would be, but not too big for my daughter's size.  The face is really nice and cute"

She loves it. My daughter is still very young and still plays with it as a hobby. I'm very happy with it. It has great detail and my daughter will love it. I'm sure she will like it even more as she grows. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this. He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood."
1,"Used the cart a few times already to move a Jackson Big Tuna yak, carting over 100 pounds of kayak and equipment.  I've had no issues with it after installing a separate tie strap in addition to the one that comes with the cart.  The extra strap is looped around the frame opposite side of the first strap which helps the weight of the kayak to remain on the entire frame and not shift to the front or back of the frame.  Without the extra strap the cart would fold-in if I hit a hole or bump when loaded.  But the light-weight of the cart and being able to easily remove the wheels from the frame make up for this little issue."

1,"I bought this because my son was given a similar track system made by a competitor and loved it for the short time it functioned (hand-me-down gift).  However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

I'm worried about the cars being damaged because my son is a bit rough with them and there seems to be no way to replace just the vehicles if this does happen. So that annoys me, but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and my son didn't stop smiling...My 9-year-old god son likes it, as well!!"
1,Finally after years of fighting algae we have a clear pond! It took a couple weeks but it has been perfect since then; we couldn't be happier. We have tried so many different things to clear up our pond and if I had known how well this worked we would have bought it years ago.
0,"Carter is devastated when, his life has been turned upside down by a man who is the leader of the group. The woman he loves, his stepmother, is a mere pawn in his plan to capture him and take him away.  The one thing he really wants to do is have a baby.  He's also determined to get her out of the group.  He has no idea where she is, but he's determined to find her.

I loved this book.  I thought the ending was a little rushed.  I loved that the author let the reader in on a little of the emotions of the characters and didn't try to put them down.  I was left wanting more.  I couldn't put it down.  I didn't want to put it down.  I can't wait to read the next book in this series.  You will enjoy reading it.

The work stand is simply smaller versions of the 5-foot miter saw stand and will therefore accept all DeWalt miter saws with the quick-disconnect attachment.

If your bike pump has the adapter that screws onto a valve, be careful removing once inflated because this tubes valve comes apart, and can attach itslef to pump adapter.

0,"Imagine taking reality TV, Star Trek, and the movie ""Planet of the Apes"" to the extreme is an insult to the people of America and the world we live in.  This movie is a sad and depressing movie.  The only reason I watched it is to see how the people of America were treated by the media and the movie industry.  If you haven't seen this movie, you're probably not even aware of it.  It's like a crime drama, except that it's not about a crime, it's about a human being who is actually put through hell.

1,"Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!

I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased opinion. It in no way influenced my review of this product. If you found this review helpful, please click the helpful button. It's nice to have the feedback  :)"
1,"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain."
0,Love this!  Super cute and looks great on my countertop.
0,"I picked up this product and it was the best. I will keep purchasing it. Very nice. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very sensitive ear. She had no issues with it, which was great. This was also great for her. I had a 2 year old German Shepherd and it was very sensitive and it was a struggle to get it to stay in place. I put a few drops on her ear and it worked very well. She was very happy with it. I would definitely recommend this product to any dog owner. I have a 15 pound Yorkie mix. She is a bit smaller than most dogs, but she is still a little bit on the small side, so I thought she would be fine. She's a bit bigger than most dogs, but she is still a little on the small side. I wish it had a small collar, but I don't think I will buy it. I would definitely recommend this product. I love this product. I use it for my dog when he's getting used to the scent of the grass, and it's very strong and lasts for a long time. It's very gentle on his skin, and it really helps him stay on his feet, he doesn't slip down and it's a great quality product. My dog loves this product. I love this product! I use it as a pet carrier and a walker. The dog is very secure and comfortable and the way the collar locks is very secure. It's easy to put on, very secure. I also use it for a day or so and it's so much easier to get the dog in and out."

1,"I received an ARC for an honest review. This was a great story and I love that I was able to read all 6 parts together. It would have been painful to have to wait in between!  The story was really involved with politics playing a major role and a tenuous treaty between shifters and humans hanging in the balance. Avelyn grew up in a school for girls dedicated to become mates for shifters. Each girl was assigned to a category of shifter, Fox, wolf, bear, Dragon, eagle. Evelyn was to be a Fox bride but she sabotaged herself by pretending to learn nothing and getting fat and failing interviews with prospective grooms. All she wanted was freedom. She was 3 months away from total freedom when Max Blackmane, Alpha werewolf, came to the school looking to buy a wife. Instead of a wolf bride, he chose the sassy Avelyn, who tried her best to fail,  even trying to run away. But they go to his home together where she feels trapped, unloved, frantic to leave. He is very patient with her and loves her spirit. But he hides something from her that may be his undoing and bring about the downfall of his clan. Evelyn cannot bear injustice and unfairness, so she will go against even her growing feelings for Max to see fairness done. Thus begins a time of terror for the Blackmane family, clan, surrounding villages, Europe, Avelyn's old school, possibly the world as they know it! Got you hooked?? Well, read the book! Besides, Max is hot and the heat between he and Avelyn is steamy! Great book!!"

1,"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it."

1,"This book was great in revealing what it's like to be in a violent and abusive relationship and stuck. Eventually mother and son go into hiding in which I can just feel their pain in having to start over in a place where they have no friends or family; no support and live in fear. How do you begin a new live when your name is not your own and you end up wherever you end up, not necessarily a place of choice? So many times we ask ourselves why does a woman stay and this book really does explain why. I have so much empathy and compassion for women in this position. It boils down to being a no-win situation to some degree. While some people did not like the ending, I did. I thought it was realistic and really does capture what's there at the end of the road."

1,"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.

The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.

This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II""."

1,"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again."
1,"WOW there are a million pieces to this set! Once we got everything punched out and sorted we could begin to build. The instructions were easy to follow and the pictures really helped. Sorting through the pieces was challenging but part of the fun. We built one ogre based on the instructions and found the pieces to be very easy to work with. The pieces are very cleanly cut and fit together well. They are soft but sturdy and will hold up to many robot builds. We went on to free build and found that to be really fun also. The possibilities are really endless with this set and I can see even teenagers enjoying building and creating different designs. Once the ogres and creatures are built you can display them or disassemble them to play another day. Fully assembled the largest ogre is about a foot tall. They store well in the box, but we opted to separate the pieces into baggies for cleaner storage. A very nice set!"
1,"This book was discussed on Amazon's romance forum. There are mixed feelings about this book. Some people just cannot get past the fact that the husband was violent towards his wife. I do not condone, in any way, physical abuse of anyone. This couple has been divorced for several years and he's had time to grow up and accept that he wrecked his marriage.  She left town and her father kept him on as a valuable employee.  Her father died so she  came back to work for his demolition business. The reunification of this couple was very slow because she did not trust him at all. I am not going to give a long-winded story since this one is not a gotcha kind of book. A young couple where the husband is so damaged and so obsessed with her  that he cannot function as a grown-up. One day he blows and hits her. The story is, for the most part, them having to live together because of her father's will. How they managed to resolve the violence issue and learn to love again is what makes this book a very good book. I did give it five stars.  All of he books are intense and very well written."

1,"I've not played the adult version of Cashflow so can't make a comparison but this game does a good job of teaching a basic tenet from the Rich Dad series: amass sources of passive income!  I bought this to play with my six year old because he's very interested in money and investing.  I thought this might be a good introduction to some basic concepts - and I believe it is a good introduction.  The instructions are not great, good enough but not great.  The instructions describe that you become a winner when your passive income exceeds your expenses - but there isn't really a winner of the game.  Small nuance but each individual ""wins"" by having passive income exceed expenses but the instructions don't state the first one to get there wins.

Each player gets a ""financial statement"" as their game card.  During play, each player gains passive income sources and expenses.  The players keep track of their passive income vs expenses on the financial statement.  When your passive income exceeds expenses... you win!  The game does a good job of reinforcing this concept and also does a good job providing examples of passive income sources (rental property, owning a business, etc.).  It's at a pretty basic level so understandable for kids; even my six year old understands the game well enough to be able to formulate a strategy or predict what he needs on the next turn in order to win.

Would recommend as a basic concept teaching tool.  And it's a fun game, too!"

1,"Talk about drama. Forever and Always by E.L. Todd is the sequel to Only for You. Honestly, I didn't care for this book as much as I was hoping. The reader can figure out real quick what is about to happen.

So, before this book, Sean, our hero, has made it to Seattle and has professed his love and apology to Scarlet. Enter a really fast and quick relationship followed by prego ex-girlfriend and a bunch of mess. I wanted to smack the hell out of the main characters. Sean didn't learn anything from the first book. He was still a complete doofus.

Scarlet was even worse. Instead of swallowing her pride, she nearly cost the destruction of her business. Not to mention, when she did swallow her pride, it was for the wrong reason. Sorry, hate to say this, but I didn't care for where it ended. Sure, time passed, but I felt that another book of them growing together versus a little tidbit about six months later, would have been the better choice.

As always with E.L. Todd, the writing isn't bad. It is quick and easy to pull through. Despite my dislike for these characters, I did like her writing enough to finish the book. I also like that Janice made an appearance and that Scarlet did grow a pair for her friend. I still feel Scar could have done something before this book, but I'm glad she did the right thing.

Really, the book wasn't bad, I just didn't care for where it was going where Sean and Scarlet are concerned."

1,"The previous spoke guard on my bike cracked where it connected to the spokes so I replaced it with this one.  The one that cracked was the original spoke guard that was on the bike when I bought it over 10 years ago.  It's not surprising that it would crack after putting a lot of miles on the bike, and over the years I suspect that this kind of material might become more fragile.  This replacement part seemed like the same style/quality/size (hard plastic) as the original, so I thought I would have no issue with it for several years.  Unfortunately, it broke at the spokes the same as the original one after only a few weeks and way fewer than 100 miles.  When I realized that it was loose, I noticed that all three places where it connected to the spokes where broken and it was spinning freely.  I don't know if all three cracked at the same time or if one cracked and the rest gave way because it couldn't handle it on only two connection points.  I don't think there is anything wrong with the derailleur or wheel or size of this guard that is causing this issue-- the bike works just fine and I've noticed no difference in my ride recently and this product fit perfectly on my spokes.  I bought two of these since they were cheap, so I will put on the second one now (or just leave it off and take my chances), but I honestly thought that I would lose/misplace the second one before I ever needed it because I thought it would be 10 years+ before I would need it."
1,"I wear a 8.5 US (41.5 UK) in Chuck Taylors and Merrills. The La Sportiva fits the same, but is tighter around the middle of the foot. This is as expected as this is my third pair of shoes from La Sportiva. The shoes are very comfortable, and what you'd expect from a hiking shoe. The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work. The soles, glue, and stitching are all in fine shape even after all that abuse."

REVIEW:
This smoking hot paranormal romance had all the aspects of the Carpathian novels we have grown to love. The danger and intrigue at times left me breathless, but that was tempered well with the love and friendship loaded on the pages. This story also had a fun group of friends that I believed had been together for years. I enjoyed Skylers strength and determination that was clearly shown without ever losing her softness.  Dimitri was perfect for her and the romance flowed smoothly. All in all a well written story that was very hard to put down and I am still lost in their world.

0,"This is a must have for anyone who wants to try out a new bat for the first time.

I had a friend who was going to have a bat in a local store that had a similar bat and we were using it for batting practice. This bat was great and we loved it. It was a bit expensive but it was worth it and it fit our needs.

We just went to Walmart and bought a new bat. It was $30 cheaper than the old bat and we were thrilled with the price. The bat was a little heavy so we put it in a bag with it and put it in a closet where it would be kept. We were able to put it in the cooler and we couldn't get it into the cooler. It was a good fit and we were able to bat practice with it.

It is a good bat and we are glad we purchased it. It is a great bat and I would recommend it to anyone.We bought this tent for our boat on the east coast of Mexico.  It was amazing how warm and cozy it was.  It was easy to set up, and the tent itself was very spacious.  We were able to sleep in the tent while we were out on the water.  We could see the water"
1,"Excellent pair of leggings! Much warmer than regular leggings which may be because of the ribbing. The elasticity is excellent, they are a great length also! I am only 5'2 so they are a bit long but I just cuff the bottom under and it's fine!  I know that taller women often have issues finding leggings of a decent length but these would be great if you are taller! The color is not a dark black but more of a smoky black. Super comfy and the pockets are an added plus so they look more like pants but have the elastic waistband of leggings. The first pair I ordered had a tiny hole on the leg but I messaged Amazon and received a replacement pair within 2 days without having to return the others first! So I am very pleased!"
1,"I went with the 30 minn kota for my 14 ft flat bottom, trying to save a little money. The small motor does decent.... your not going anywhere in a hurry, lol. Also, if it is pretty windy, you are going to struggle, I took this motor to land between the lakes, and tried to use it to move around the main banks on a very windy ""white cap day""...... it worked okay. if your trying to move towards the direction the wind is coming from, you may have some issues. I have used this little motor on 3 different boats, my 14 ft flat bottom, a 12 ft flat bottom we rented (10HP max lake), and a 10 ft v bottom. It works about the same on all 3, the small 10 footer is a heavy boat, maybe even heavier than my 14 ft.

Bottom line, it will do the job. It will move you around coves, or even across small, not so windy channels. BUT.... if you can afford to spend another 65 bucks, just buy the 40 LBS, I can promise you, you will be happier with it. Not saying Im not happy with this small motor, but I do wish I had the extra 10 ft LBS for windy days, or rivers with a swifter current. If you cant afford the other one, or refuse to wait any longer and saye up (like I did.... lol, couldn't wait), buy this one. Like I said, small boats, calm lake, you will get around pretty good. On a river, stronger current, or a windy day.... not so much. Hope this helps someone."

The kettle is a little louder and it's a bit louder when I open the door. The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable. I love it. I did get a free sample of this kettle at the store. I received my free sample of this kettle at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Thank you!I bought this as a Christmas present for my son for his first time. He loves it, and he loves it. It is a nice size for a small toddler, and I am very happy with the purchase. I can't wait to use it for gifts for my son. We are very happy with this purchase!Great bedspread. I bought this for my 2 year old to sleep on while she's sleeping. It works great. It's very light and soft. It's not thick like some other sheets I've seen. I've had it for over a year now and it's still holding up well. I've never had it break or have it fall apart. I also like the way it's folded and the fact that it has a flat bottom so it doesn't clog up the pillows. I've had it for about a month now and it's still holding up well. It's very comfortable and comfortable to sleep on. It was a gift for my 2 year old. I love the fact that this is made in China."

The blades are very sturdy, and the pieces are very thin. I would not recommend this product. I have a 2 year old, and I have had to buy blades for her. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing blades for a child. This product is very well made, and the blades are very well made. My son loves it!  He is 6 years old and loves this dollhouse!  We have not had any problems with the kids breaking the locks and the furniture, but my son is not into the dolls at all. He likes the dolls and the little pieces that are made of plastic. The plastic parts are small and don't really work together. It would be nice if this dollhouse had some plastic parts that could be removed. The other items I have purchased are for the wooden pieces. The pieces are very easy to break, and the furniture is very easy to set up and put on. It's not a toy that is easy for a 4 year old to play with. The pieces are very small and don't hold up very well. I would not recommend this dollhouse. I received this item as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it."

It's a good value for the money. This was a gift for my niece. She loves it!  I did get a free item and it is a great gift. We love this set. It's a great size. I like that the pieces are interchangeable. It is also very easy to assemble. I love that it comes with two small pieces that you can attach to the sides of the ship. We've put it together over a year and it still looks great. I also like that the pieces are easy to put together. My son was able to cut down the number of pieces by removing the pieces. It's a great addition to any Lego set. Our toddler loves this game. It is cute and easy for him to play. The game is good for older kids who like to play with older kids. The story is well-made and the characters are well-made. The cards are well-written and well-coloured. The game is easy enough for a 4-6 year old to play. The game is a fun game for a group of friends who like to play with their friends. This is an excellent game for a family game night.

It takes a little while for her to realize what is going on. She gets a call from a nurse and is immediately interested in the baby. There is a lot of potential here for a romance between a nurse and her baby. I loved the way the story went about this mystery. The romance was believable, but the pregnancy was not as great as the other two. I would like to see more of a storyline between the two of them. I found myself wanting more and was a little disappointed. There were too many spelling and grammar errors and I was a little confused at the end. I would have liked to see more of the story. I really enjoyed this book. It's a quick read. I can't wait for the next book in this series. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

It is hard to get the pieces in the box. My daughter is still waiting for her first birthday party. She's a huge fan of the show and the kids love to play with it. I just wish there was more to it. Great. I like that the pieces are very small and have a nice twist. The smaller pieces are nice and easy to store. My 5 year old has found the smaller pieces are difficult to put together and not as sturdy. I would definitely buy this again. Very nice item. I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas and he was obsessed with it. It's very cool and sturdy and he loves it. We had to go back to the original and put the pieces back together. It was a little pricey for a 5 year old and the price was a lot lower than we paid for it. I don't know if it's a quality issue, but it's a nice little toy. This is a great card for all my kids to have in their deck. The colors are vibrant and my kids love them. I like that there is a lot of cards that can be played with. My daughter loves this little train set!  It's a good size for a little child to play with. My 2 year old daughter loves this train set. It's very easy to assemble. It's fun for little hands.

1,"I have enjoyed using this coffeemaker on a daily basis.  I have not had the error problem that some reviewers have mentioned but I use a travel mug to fill the container for the single brew side which keeps it from overfilling. ,  I can't speak to the durability as yet since  have only had it for about 3 weeks but it works very well so far.
Update 9/21/14:  Have now had this for about 10 months.  It still works very well; am using on a daily basis and have not even had to do any deep cleaning(vinegar rinse etc).  Have been very satisfied with brew results from the k cups and from the carafe.  Not as satisfied with the single cup loose grounds brew though; don't use that option very often so haven't mastered the right portion of water for the strength I want.
The only errors I have had is when I wanted to brew a single cup but left the selector on the carafe setting.  That's ok thought as long as the carafe is always left in place because the single cup will just come out into the carafe. If you do not leave the carafe in place all the time though you would have a cup of coffee pouring onto the counter. If you do the opposite though and leave the selector on the single cup setting when you want to brew a carafe, it will not cause a problem because the machine just gives an error message and doesn't let the water come through - very clever, almost foolproof design."

Comes with a carrying bag, I laughed when I thought of taking it apart. However I did because I returned it. Here's the real honest truth, cheap ,flimsy and over priced. The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2. The other side of the tent isn't lined, the poles which Velcro the cover to the house at the bottom pop off. I really can't say anything nice about this item."

I gave only 4 stars because the glossary often doesn't contain words that are used in the text....really, a minor objection since there are excellent sources on the web; and because rarely the translations are wrong...but in those cases it is obviously a misprint.  Again very minor objections.  Because of this book I am buying many of the of other PMP series.

The growing love story was exactly what was needed.  And the baby was perfect, even if she was too young to speak.  I really wanted to have a bit more at the end.

1,"This brilliant debut album by the late, great guitar legend is also one of the best albums of all time and you'll see this album in the top half of practically every top 100 lists of best albums and for very good reason too.  Released in 1967, the year of The Beatles' ""Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band"" this rock hard power trio combo was unlike anything that anyone had ever heard before except perhaps Pete Townsend's The Who and Eric Clapton's Cream but the influence was immense and rock music was never the same again.  No weak tracks on this album and every track is brilliant here with no fillers in sight.  This version of this seminal album is also the best one that's out there at present.  The sound quality has been remastered very, very well and the mini-lp replica cardboard packaging is a work of art too.  We get two bonus tracks albeit in mono: ""Highway Chile"" and ""51st Anniversary"" but all 17 tracks are simply gems and classic rock standards.  We get a 24 page colour booklet with all the lyrics plus great liner notes about the band plus another booklet which contains the lyrics in Japanese as well.  For fans and students of great classic rock as well as aspiring rock guitarists out there, this, indeed all Jimi's albums are required listening.  Very, very highly recommended!"

1,"The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off."

1,"My 5 year old and my 3 year old really enjoyed the DohVinci Deluxe Styler.  They played with it back and forth between them for around an hour. There was a little bit of fighting over who's turn it was so you know they liked using it.

The Play-Doh that comes out of the tubes is not traditional Play-Doh. It's a softer compound making it easy enough for kids to squeeze. The Styler gun is simple to use; the kids didn't need any help changing it out. My 3 year old was able to do it a couple of times, but couldn't after his hands were reportedly ""wet"". I'm not sure if he had been putting his fingers in his or just clammy kid hands. I don't know why, sometimes kids just got clammy hands, they don't know either. Anyway aside from ""wet"" hands the kids were able to completely utilize the DohVinci Styler.

Another point about it not being traditional Play-Doh is that it's not reusable. When you finished with regular Play-Doh the kids clean it up by putting it back in the container it came in for use another day. This DohVinci Play-Doh is a one shot deal. It has to be thought of as more of an Art project medium than regular Play-Doh."

1,"The single DVD version with the concept of the ""probes"" being sent from a future human race was a very upbeat and inovative plot device for this vision of Earth-after-man. That is what we all saw on the Animal Planet version of this show. Each of the ages was treated the same in the full length episodes as they were in the introductery condenced one hour form. They added probes and the omnipresent narrarator to guide us through each hour. I was enthralled with the whole weird thing! Completely swept away!
So,when I got this collection of British talking heads beaming at how smart they all were to have theorised all these creatures out of nothing but thin air-headedness,I was disenchanted at best. They all came off as arrogant and way too self satisfied. While listening you could hear the flaws in many of the basic assumtions. The ecologies and behaiviors shown were often far too over simplified to create their ""new possibilities"". As a viewer your suspention of disbelief was completely shot! There was no way to invest your imagination in these soap bubble epocs being constantly reminded that they are just creations.
Obviously,I am in the minority here and I'm shouting ""FIRE"" long after the smoke has cooled. So be it. This is one of the very few times that the more intellectual cut was all wrong. The US versions were much better films in every way; repeat footage and all. You were viewing events,not ideas. It might have sold better too."

1,"Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt."

1,"This film doesn't pretend to be perfect.  It is open about how flawed people move forward amidst the heartbreak that each of us undoubtedly encounter in our fallen world. Instead of a movie saying, ""here is a package that ties with a silk ribbon on top"" it instead says ""walk along with me, I am hurting too, and I am willing to respond in an inclusive manner rather than hardening in my isolation and spitting my hatred all over anyone that comes close""...It is this message that I found refreshing, and maybe even a little inspiring.  If you like independent films for the performances that seem to set celebrities free from micro managed scripts...you will probably like 'Begin Again'."

1,"Loved it!  I enjoyed all the references to the hokey celebrity xmas specials of my youth.  And the nod to Pee Wee Herman's xmas special - a classic.  I nearly fell out of my chair laughing when Stephen chimed in on Willie Nelson's homage to xmas weed.  It's a direct musical quote from the strangest xmas duet of all time --- David Bowie and Bing Crosby singing Little Drummer Boy.  YouTube it.  It was surreal then, it's surreal now.  Hats off to the songwriters.  Very, very clever all the way around.  And Jon Stewart!!  What a gem!  (""And now, for the Hannukah portion of the show . . ."" to quote Mrs. Rene from Pee Wee's show.)  And did I catch a Kirk/Spock moment there through the cabin door?  I got goosebumps.
Can't recommend it highly enough.  If you have a bent sense of humor and love pop culture this show will push your buttons.
p.s.  I can't tell if Toby Keith is in on the joke or not.  It reminds me of Warhol's Tomato Soup can.  Soup.  Art.  Soup.  Art."

First of all, the front-window-compartment is very difficult for the kids to take off. The only way, to place a fireman on the drivers-seat is to take off this window-compartment. Second of all, the ladder comes off every time, my kids just touch it. A grown-up has to install it back on the firetruck. I don't know, why Playmobil couldn't come up with a different solution for this, but it's very frustrating for the kids, that it won't stay installed and they can't fix it themselves. The ladder won't stay up plus falls off the truck. The rest of the firetruck seems very sturdy and has bright colors. Love the sound-effects on it. Not too loud."

The title is difficult to understand, as it contains so much information.  Titles and information needs to be clear and not ambiguous and this item title could be much clearer.

While the ear pads look to be functional, what I got won't work 100% on the G930.  I really thought it would work.  Can't the seller be clear on what works?  Can't the seller provide a G930 BLACK ear pad and pillow?"

Exceeds my expectations. I would have given this reel five stars for price point but will need to see the reels longevity and durability to rate it that high. I will say everything Alan reviewed to be true. If  you have never fought bull reds in the surf Ill just say it qualifies for hard use. This reel is not refined but is very well made. I would trust it over my much more expensive Shimano reels for big game. The drag is unbelievable and can handle heavy tackle. I wish I would have bought two of these reels because now you cant find one and the prices have already gone up 20%. I REEEEALLY hope the quality does not go down on this reel because I believe Fin-Nor has hit a home run with this one. I fish this reel next to five Shimanos in the Texas gulf.

He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big  threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would  Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks,  Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to  Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance  of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this  book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way."

SPEED DEMON is no exception, although this is one of his less entertaining films.  The others at least had some modicum of suspense and/or horror.  This movie has no suspense, no horror, no real gore, no sex scenes (unless you count the numerous times the boys spread some kind of blood all over their buff chests.  DeCoteau is obviously a director who caters to his alternative lifestyle audience, and while I have no real problem with this, he should at least make the movie a lot more interesting than this dull dud.  The identity of the speed demon is so hilarious, it defies belief."

1,"Really cute in theory. But as others mentioned no instructions came with it and it didn't fit together well in any manner I tried. As time was running out I had no option but to use it but it was very wobbly/unbalanced in the only way I could get it together, and I had to rig a way to make it stand somewhat straight by tying plastic strips tightly around the bottom stem. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't correct these flaws numerous people have informed them of since it is a really pretty design. Just makes you think they don't care, and if they don't why should anyone else?"
1,This series is my absolute favorite.  Very believable in a science fiction way and impossible to put it down once you start..even though I never wanted it to end.  Thank you Mr Goleman
0,"Nadia and Ty. I digress.

We begin with a first person narration of the story.

I had to say, ""Okay, I'm not going to say it's a spoiler, but it's a spoiler, and it's going to be a spoiler.""

I was looking forward to reading the book, but I just didn't think I was going to get it. It was so predictable, I actually had to get it back.

But, I was very happy with the ending, and I will definitely be reading more of this book!

You'll be able to read this book at your leisure, and you won't be disappointed. I'm glad I gave it to a friend.I loved this book. It was an awesome read and I was really excited to see the movie. I hope the book is a good one.This is the first time that I have read this book. I've had it read by other people but never read it by me. The descriptions are beautiful and the way the characters speak is so well written. I love the characters and how the story is told. The ending was a bit abrupt but it was nice to have a happy ending.I have been reading this book for a while now."

I was able to secure to the window sill with screws provided and for now it seems stable enough.  The tiny pieces of hook and loop tape provided are a ridiculous way to secure. I guess it's comparable with the cost."
1,"I have back and foot injuries, so low impact exercising is a must for me at the moment (hoping this will someday change). This trampoline is about as low impact as a a vertical land/terrestrial unit can be.

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quickly enough. Because spring coils are not used in this trampoline, it has a quieter action than traditional mini trampolines. It is a very sturdy unit. Absolutely love this thing. The ""petals"" help to widen the jumping surface, and also help warn me (when my foot feels the petal edges) when I am straying too far from the center of the trampoline. My college age daughter now comes to my room every day to exercise on the trampoline as well :).

If I were going to purchase this item again, I would consider springing for the larger size. I think that a larger surface would allow for my complex moves during exercise sessions. I won't take any points off for this, though, since I was aware of the measurements when I placed my order."

Loved the relationship that grew over email and texts which blossomed into a true connection that couldn't be ignored.  Loved how it ended up!  Love me some hockey hunks!"
1,"Nice unit, although shipped with old firmware that supposedly has problems under 10.3.9. Since the drive has no direct contact with the case, and there is no fan, I would be reluctant to use it for a hot running drive. The attachment did not seem very well designed, and I could see the drive breaking loose. But these same weaknesses are also a strength; firmware can be upgraded, no fan means silent, and the rubber hard drive attachments insulate against noise. I was pleased with the value.

Failed on me, looked like corrupted firmware that could not be updated."

It also comes with a little keychain type hook, so you can connect it to your keys or a lanyard. This is: Compatible with Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS 10+ and Linux; Hi-Speed USB 2.0 port required for high speed transfer. I think this is a great deal for how much GBs you get! The ONLY complaint I have is that it did NOT fit in my Xbox. My spouse wanted to use it for extra storage for the xbox gaming system. Because of the frog body, it would not fit in the console. It does fit in my desktop though, so Im sure Ill get use out of it for work or home storing photos etc. I purchased this product at a discount for me to test and review.

It is so much easier to operate than the one I had with the old saw. The TK-38 is a great knife for the price and is made well. I've had it for about a year now and I love it. The blade is smooth and a perfect knife for the job. I've used it for the past year, and I'm very pleased with the results. I'm a professional and am a good customer. I love the way my car looks.

1,"I loved it, I was worried it wouldn't fit me or would be too tight since I usually see smaller waist girls wear these styles when I go to music festivals, So I was actually very surprised that this fit also there was a little slack left so that I can wear it loosely on my hip.

This modernize fanny pack met all my needs and more. There are three pockets on the side which I felt was very secured since I kept my phone in the inner pocket versus the outer pocket.

There is also small pocket in the front that is secured with a zipper and a bottom (I kept my cash there).

Must buy you can use this anywhere, especially if your one of those girls that hate carrying purses everywhere.

Brielle, Chelle and Meachy all found themselves caught up but I wasn't expecting the secrets that came about. Blake was just trifling and doing the most. Here I thought he was messing up one situation but so much more came with it. Brielle was wrong but it was nothing she could do to change the way things panned out. I liked Brandon and his boldness at dinner and that really had me cracking up. I was pissed about the lie he told at his office but I guess he was doing what he thought was best. Eliana seemed like a very sweet person and I hate how what she thought was something special was built from lies. Chelle and Meachy had me so confused but once I started understanding what was what it really threw me for a loop. Meachy's role wasn't excused but she didn't have to let everybody else's secrets out to save her own ass. I'll admit I had a wtf look once Chelle found out Brielle's secret because I was thinking how in the world can she be mad when she's no better. Monique was bitter and wanted her cake and eat it too. Her response to KJ let me know she didn't have it all. Once the secrets started flowing it was like they'd never end. So much trust was broken but the very secrets that destroyed so much also had some good to come about. As always great job Toni and I can't wait to see what you come out with next."
0,Pretty useless- ordered 2 of these. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one I received from the company is the most defective.

I have a 2 year old who can use the lid with a strong enough grip.

4 years later and having no issues with this system.  I am using it with a generation 2 SmartThings system.  This is the one just before Samsung purchased them.  I had no trouble setting it up.  I had it for a second home and wanted to remotely be able to cool the house before going to it.  Forgetting to manually turn the AC in the summer can be expensive.  It more than paid for itself in electrical bills by being able to control it remotely after forgetting to turn down the thermostat!"

The wire punches are just as well made as the original wire punches, and are as durable as the originals. The only thing I would change is to order the 3-pack of the wire punches separately. I already have one of these, so I'll keep it for now. I like that the wire punches have a strong surface to them, which makes them easy to use, and also that the wire punches are a little longer than the originals."

1,"Multi author anthology - themed if you think the fact that both stories consist of 3 guys and 1 girl counts as a theme...  Let's be honest, it's a sexfest.  If that's what you're looking for, it delivers.

Pillow Talk  by Maya Banks starts out with the h/h [committed relationship] discussing their fantasies such as voyeurism and multiple partner sex.  Each decides to give the other their fantasies - which leads to some unforeseen complications; especially when they draw in other players...  WARNING:  this story contains fulfillment of a kidnap/forced sex fantasy - if this is an issue for you, stay away!  On the other hand, if you have hot firemen fantasies, this story is for you!

Her Fantasy Men by Shayla Black has the 3 heroes conspiring to get the heroine's attention - so she can choose them!  Most interesting to me was them trying to resolve their different loving styles - from the 'kisses and cuddles' guy to the 'tie them up and spank them' dominant.

Neither story contains male/male contact."

1,"This is the best invention ever!  I was always afraid of pressure cookers because of the noises that came from the ones used by my parents when I was a kid. I always thought the top was going to blow off at any minute!  That fear kept me from pressure cooking for a very long time. I happened to see a Youtube video of someone cooking in one of these and they explained that they are safe because there are several layers of safety designed right into this that prevent the problems associated with the earlier stove-top pressure cookers.  Curious, I purchased this one and now I'm hooked.  There are 4 appliances in my kitchen that I cannot live without: my Zojirushi rice cooker, Nuwave oven, Nutribullet, and my Instant Pot!  If any one of these wore out I'd just turn around and immediately order another one!

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One more thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flavor!  Any spices you use are forced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.  Mmmmm good!  There are so many recipes available and tons of Youtube videos for cooking ideas.  Get one - have fun, and enjoy delicious food in a little time."

1,"The best thing about this DVD: a chance to be introduced to some of most wonderful music beyond the standard repertory.  As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.

However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.

If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago."

The only thing I had an issue with was that were a bit on the slippery side, a little more grip on the sole would have been better for us."
0,"Another installment in the Harry Potter series, the Harry Potter series is a lot like the Harry Potter series.  The story is told from Harry's point of view, and it is interesting to see what happens to the characters.  Harry's one flaw is that Harry is such a complicated character.  There are a lot of people in the story who have flaws, but they are all very different.  This book is a lot like the Harry Potter books, with a lot of twists and turns.

The characters are interesting.  I loved the characters.  They are very realistic and believable.  They are definitely different from the Harry Potter books.  The plots are interesting, but I did not like the way the stories were told.  I didn't like how the characters were described.  I did like how Harry was portrayed as being a teenager.

1,"These are adorable shoes and they fit well. My daughter is 6 months and I bought the 0-6 months size because Robeez tend to run large. She has some space to grow, so I anticipate they'll fit her for some time yet--hopefully until the summer at least. There is about a fingertip of space towards the toe. The flower strap does not open, but stretches to accommodate the foot, and I anticipate these will stay on just as well as her Robeez boots. I've tried buying Robeez knockoffs (the ones at Target) and they never stay on or don't fit right, whereas these fit great and are wonderfully constructed. The only real disappointment is that they are made in China. I am always somewhat concerned about quality control with regard to goods coming out of China, but it's very difficult to avoid such products. However, these do look like they were constructed with care."

Also, the first time I used it, I zipped it up once and when I unzipped it THE ZIPPER FELL OFF. I tried to get a refund through Amazon but I had to go through this third party seller. It was a huge hassle. I had to send them pictures of the broken zipper and they had issues opening the picture file even though it was a picture I took on my smart phone and sent it to them directly in an email. They would not take a return or give me a full refund. They offered to refund $5 to my credit card to make up for the broken zipper.

It is a good value for the price. I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it! He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift. We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or it can be put in a closet or it can be put in a pocket. It is very warm and easy to keep in your room."

1,"It's very sleek and fits nicely on my keychain, so I won't have to worry about having a flash drive when I need it.  For large files, though, it's much slower than any other flash drive I have.  I bought the 16GB version so I could move large files back and forth between computers, but it's a bad choice for that role.  A 500MB file took almost 3 minutes to save on this drive (avg 3.5 MB/second), compared to a bit more than a minute on an old Sandisk Cruzer drive. If you're moving small .mp3s on and off, you'll love it.  If you want to move big files, you'll need lots of patience -- or another drive."

1,"I don't prefer any of the stand-alone variations to the original Carcassonne and its expansions, but Gold Rush is definitely my favorite of them.

Compared with the original:
-Railroads score similarly to roads (score double if only one tile has a locomotive)
-Farmers score based on native villages (2 points each) and horse riders (4 points each) in the field
-Mountains score the number of gold nuggets showing on the tiles
-A City tile scores 3 points for each complete connected railway
-At game's end, acquired mining tokens are revealed, gold is tallied and added to the final score

Gold Rush is challenging in a couple of ways. You only get 4 meeples, so throwing out that farmer too early will limit your options more than in the original game.  Placing one on a city tile is also risky, because you don't get it back until all connecting railroads are completed.  Also, other players can place a tent into a mountain your worker is attempting to mine, and they can mine it too (with some limitations). When you score the mountain you get all unclaimed tokens, but unless you did it quickly, there might not be any left to claim.

I don't much like the surprise victory points from the mining tokens at the end. It would be more strategic to know the value of what you have acquired as the game progresses, but that's a minor thing.  I really like the economy of decisions, in which you can choose not to place a worker, and instead take a mining token from a mountain you have claimed, or move your tent to a different tile within a mountain that contains more mining tokens.  The direct competition for mining tokens is a nice change of pace for me, but others might not like this aspect.  Overall, I think there's a slightly elevated tension in this variation of what is usually a pretty casual game, and I really enjoy it."
1,"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has been her devoted ally for years and is determined to help her heal.  While I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit hard for me to get into.  I realize all the reasons for how the book is laid out considering the ending... but it seemed to be drawn out and sometimes slow. The ending was a cliff hanger and ended rather unexpectedly.  Still Ms. Bailes is a fine author.  Her story flows, there are no spelling or grammar errors which makes the story easy to follow.  It seemed to take awhile to really get to the heart of the book but once I did, I found myself eagerly following along, cheering for Ali and Blake.  Give Shattered and Shaken a chance.  I'll be looking to add the next parts of this series to my collection."

The chemistry between the two main characters is off the charts and the writer makes you believe. I love the action between these two characters,I just wish for a tad bit more story and a little more from the supporting cast. The story moves at a fast pace so that you are not bored or bogged down with unnecessary drama. The execution is excellent,you get glimpses of emotions and feelings. This was a really good solid story,one you can not regret reading. I would love to see a revised version and it be released if possible and with a not so abrupt ending."

Review for/Author: Eva Gordon
Book title: Alpha Wolfs Pet 2, Kept
Page length: 171
Price at time: $2.99
Review:  I was first introduced to Eva Gordons work through her first book in this series, Alpha Wolfs Pet book 1, hidden. I loved book 1 and have been waiting for book 2. I read book two in one day. The characters and setting are well developed. You can visually see where things are taking place and why. This story will grab you right away and you will not want to put it down.  The story doesnt leave you with a cliffhanger, but leaves you wanting more. I will be looking forward to book three. (Please read book one first)

Overview: Mia has just with through a huge ordeal. She was exposed to the secret society of werewolfs. She now has to agree to sign a non-disclosure and have the option of being his pet girlfriend (since wolves cant marry humans). Knowing that she is hiding from the mob and Dominic has offered to keep her safe and love her, she decides to sign the contract. But soon realizes that she will be subjected to obey all wolf laws, which includes being submissive to the alpha and being low man on the totem pole with the other wolfs, and with the werewolf King coming soon for his dead sons body, she struggles more. Mia is whisked away so the werewolf King will not order Dominic to execute her. When the werewolf King comes, he is not happy about what has happened with his son, with Dominic and his pet, nor is he happy that Dominic has a Pet instead of a Mate. Will Dominic be able to help Mia and save her from the Russian mob and deal with the werewolf King?

1,"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right."

1,"I rarely buy bras without trying them on so I took a chance with this one.  I wear a 40c in most bras, including JC Penney Ambrielle.  One review said the cup size ran large, and I thought it was a tiny bit large when I put it on, but I also know that later in the day, when gravity gets working, I will fill those wee bit too big cups!  The band size is true.  I do have it on the end hook (the loosest one) but that's my body, not the bra size.  It says no bounce and it is no bounce.  This is not a bra for a 34A (if they even  make it in that size).  As other reviews have said, it's so comfortable it's a wear all day bra, not just for working out or sports.  I have scar tissue on  my torso from surgery and I have a real problem getting comfortable bras.  I can't wear underwire and usually the band is tight for me.  This one is right on the money."

1,"This thing is pretty easy to assemble, and pretty easy to charge.  Got it to take off, but it tends to bank pretty hard in a random direction even in no wind.  Lots to compensate for.  Well, there was a lot to compensate for...before it caught fire.

After about 5-10 minutes of flying, it came in for a landing, tilted a few inches from the ground, caught the grass and flipped.  Not a hard landing at all, and no physical damage.  On picking it back up, the propellers were spinning at full speed (with the throttle off) and smoke was coming out of the battery compartment.  I quickly removed the battery, and could see where the circuit board had caught fire.  So, this one is being retired after one use.  I'm not risking hurting someone or damaging property.

On the other hand, if you're looking for something to catch fire in mid air (maybe for a movie or something), this could be the perfect product for you."

1,"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

1,"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's."
1,"So-so.  That's how'd I'd describe this romance collection.

As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.

The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even.

If you are interested in historical accuracy and developed characters, skip this one.  If you want a story to entertain you on a rainy afternoon, it will do the trick just fine."

1,"If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters."

My only complaint is that the light is not bright enough.  I used this light on a tile that I had to bend and"
1,"One of the best purchases I have made this decade.  I have a woman....and ""older"" woman who just does not have the grip that I used to for home repairs.  I have tried various electric screwdrivers from name-brand companies like Black and Decker but they just did not give me the push I needed.  A friend recommended this from across the Country, so he had to convince me that....no, it is not too heavy for me.  Yes, it is very easy to grip, load, and charge.  Yes, it has plenty of power and will hold the charge through all my projects!  He recommended that I just get a board and put screws in it, then reverse and take out.  I did....I only needed to do that twice before I was all over the inside and outside of my house taking care of those long-awaited projects.  I actually laid it down in the kitchen and forgot where I put in a week ago.  I thought I was going to go through withdrawal!  I have been using this tool at least every other day since I got it and am now creating new projects to use it with.  Trust this girl who has more power tools than most men!"
1,"I wonder sometimes why we write reviews of dog kibble when we ourselves are not end users.  Statistics about ingredients are on all the packages, and I tell you the dogs do.not.care.  They eat !

We have a chihuahua mix and two New Mexican terriers.  They have  slightly different menus, but share the same kibble.

I was not able to see any difference with the bigger dogs in eating the two kibbles.  Seemed to be all the same.  Point being, it was apparently eaten equally in both cases.

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

A three becomes a four.  Bigger dogs, just another kibble.  Little dog  more,  daddy.  The difference was astounding.

Try it with your dogs.  It seems to be good stuff to certain  types of dogs.  I rate it a four."

1,"What an amazing way to end this series!

When we first where introduced to Asa, I was not impressed, he was the con man, a bad brother and up to no good. It was in Rome's book that he really started coming around and I really started to like him. I wanted him to turn things around, and he was trying really hard to be a better person. In this book, I just totally feel for him and my heart was at times breaking for him. He was trying so hard, but also so resigned to the fact that he was not a good person, that he was going to screw up and disappoint the people in his life. I loved Royal, she was strong and fierce, she was struggling with some of the same issues as Asa in the beginning, but otherwise, she was a woman that knew what she wanted and was not afraid to go after it, would not comprise who she was and her morals for anyone. She was strong and yet vulnerable. I really loved them together and their potential to be together.

Jay did a beautiful job wrapping this series up and giving everyone their happily ever after. I have loved every book, every Marked Man, every woman that has been their match. This has been an amazing series and I have enjoyed being on this wild ride with these guys. I am sad that it is over, but also can't wait to see what she has in store for us next!"
1,"Welcome to the world of Johnny Quid: London in flux between the old school fixers, new school Russian money, and petty thieves in between. Guy Ritchie takes you on a wild ride through the madness and mayhem that begins with the a shady real estate deal and never lets up. This perfectly paced piece of action adventure stars some great actors, including Tom Wilkinson who delivers an awesome performance. Everyone does a great job as they pursue their individual goals through a landscape studded with bizarre, yet linked incidents. Some of it is contrived, but all good movies are. Sit back, enjoy the ride and watch this movie at least three times to catch all the subtlety. Guy Ritchie is a brilliant director. I only wish he would make more movies."

SoundPEATS gave superb customer service once I contacted them. ALL companies should value their customers like this co. does.

OK only IMO. Sound quality unimpressive, buttons are right where you would touch them if you are pushing these buds back in your ears, so I was continually turning them off by accident. Granted there's not a lot of real estate on these things for the buttons, so maybe I'm too critical, but no matter what sound quality disappointing."
1,"I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I admit, that I was a little confused at first. The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.

Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.

They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.

One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.

This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.

Maybe that's a good thing...."

1,"Death at Breakfast by Beth Gutcheon is a highly entertaining murder mystery that delighted me from the beginning. When two women arrive at an inn to take a cooking class together their stay turns into an unexpected adventure. What was meant to test how well the two companions travel together turned into an experiment of solving a murder...first there are the celebrities who like always act like they are bigger than life and charge through places like it's their right. The make the lives of others serving them totally chaotic...and unsettles the rest of the people at the inn. Soon, there is a room that catches fire and it's not long until a dead body is found. The two companions both Maggie and Hope decide that it's up to them to solve the case before the wrong person is charged. They know with high profile people involved that the pressure on the police, as well as the deputy sheriff, will prove to be a struggle. All want the case closed and solved asap. Can the two women solve it before it's too late?

Beth Gutheon's latest novel, Death at Breakfast, provides us readers with a pair of sleuth women and a cozy atmosphere that turns into a deadly mysterious setting. The women pair with the deputy sheriff and it's a race against time to solve the death. The masterfully woven tale brings a lot of humor, wit, and suspense to every page. The plot moved by fast creating an urge to read faster...then there's the intrigue of who done it and why that lured me deeper into the heart of this novel. I loved the variety of characters...their personalities, as well as careers, varied and that, too made this one highly entertaining read. Both Maggie and Hope reminded me of Miss Fletcher and Miss Marple. I can definitely see this novel becoming a big TV hit with fans everywhere. Overall, I highly recommend this thriller and crime title to readers worldwide."

People who do not know how to use one. unskilled home owner. can ruin the BEST most EXPENSIVE tool on the Market. When cutting. push the Saw all the way down on the FOOT and apply adequate pressure to keep it there as sawing. do not FORCE the SAW too hard to make the cut. Watch out for BLADE BINDING by the Material you are cutting starts pinching the blade. you can burn the Motors out by too much MUSCLE forcing it down thru the cut. or binding the blade!. I will update after using my Saw. They are a great tool don't know what I would do without one!!!!. Cheers. Tim.

I don't see why i should have to pay anything at all, i fulfilled my end by paying the first time and i have not received your item. on top you said i signed for it so i would appreciate it if you could get a copy and  email it to me so i can see where i supposedly signed for the shipment i have not received. if yourparcel is not willing to send an other one out to no cost to me, i would appreciate a full refund so i can give my money to an other company where it is more appreciated and where they won't try to make a fool out of me.

Unfortunately there must be a design flaw with them as they seem to blow out every 3-4 months or so and at $9/bulb it gets annoying!  The reviews on this said that they last for a long long time so I am hoping this really keeps going for a while!

I liked the darker blacklight style of the other one as it was dimly lit. This literally lights up the entire 55 gallon tank it is super bright and then lights up the floor around it. Pretty cool looking bulb and supposedly throw heat down towards the snake up to 16 inches. He seems to be more active when this light is on. Hopefully it does not harm him at all."

Ember Casey is amazing! The character development of Dante and Ashlyn was well written. We were able to see how their love story came full circle three years later. It was nice that it wasn't just the female pining for the male. We see there's more to how Dante feels about Ash than just sex. Ash did want to lean on her BFF Jack. Maybe using jack and her work to keep her from meeting other men or moving past her feelings for Dante. But that's ok you have to read the book to see how it turns out.

But, all kidding aside, this is a good movie. The actors were good, the writers were good; I guess almost everyone involved in getting this film out did a good job! The plot was creative and interesting and while I DID guess some of the outcomes, the ending came out of nowhere and really blew me away! I was NOT expecting that one and that's one of the things I love in a movie. Movies should be entertaining, have a good plot, have good actors (even if they're not well known), good direction and keep you interested from the first frame to the last and sometimes even give the viewer a great surprise they weren't expecting at all. This movie did all of that. I'd definitely recommend it and think it's worth both your time and your money."

1,"I really enjoyed reading about Fiona's life. She had to change her life plans after her father died and ended up teaching in Paradise Falls. Fiona lived with the Haydn family. They are a very interesting family. The two brothers are nothing alike, and the mother favors one brother so it is an awkward situation. Fiona really was an awesome teacher and Gray a stand up guy.  I really enjoyed this book."

1,This book is great. And even though it takes place in 1938 some things never change like the jealousy she feels towards Eve even though they're bffs. I didn't pick up on whom she married and had to go back and read that part and there really was no clue aside from the name. I really didn't understand why Tinker just left and felt that could've been explained better. But I really liked the descriptions of New York and all the places that aren't there anymore. I had no idea the subway pictures were real or would've paid more attention to them.

1,"I have to say it's been years since I have felt so engaged reading a book.  Oddly, I saw the movie before buying the Kindle book; and in the middle of reading, I decided to watch the movie again.  I suspect it won't be long and I will read the book once again.

This is a thinking person's book and story, and thus isn't for everyone.  But the mastery of the writing is so highly evocative that you ""see"" the book as you read it.  Incredibly deep characters, mesmerizing continuity of theme (which some might argue about, given that the book is written as segments contributing to a ""writ large"" story), the ability to make you laugh, cry and inevitably sigh, ""yes.""

I had never heard of David Mitchell before reading this book.  But it only took me 500+ pages to realize what an important writer and artistic voice he is.

I am a strong supporter of public libraries, and have downloaded Kindle versions of books to determine if I will actually buy the book.  In the case of Cloud Atlas, it was a no-brainer.  I finished Cloud Atlas today and immediately downloaded ""Ghostwritten"" from my local library.  I suspect it won't be long and my Kindle cloud will have all of his works in it.

If you think and therefore read, and read to think, Cloud Atlas will keep your mind whirling.  It's a must-read piece of literature. It's a truly gripping story."
1,"I was reluctant to try this process, feeling a bit snobby as a mid-career artist with a BFA and MFA in painting. I was leery of sappiness of this program. But finding myself frustrated with my work, feeling too tightly wound and over analytical, it was just the anecdote I needed. In some ways this program is the counterbalance to my MFA program which I finished 15 yrs ago and left me firmly planted in my brain - thinking, thinking, thinking - over thinking. This book helped me to create again through my intuition and to trust my instincts. I'm certainly not suggesting that thought and analysis are not important integral parts of art making which is at its core problem solving. But I do agree with the premise that artistic ""block"" stems from living too much in your brain.

The book gives you simple weekly and daily exercises that are reflective and thoughtful. There is plenty of talk of ""god"" or ""spirit"" ""source"" or ""universe"" but it also clarifies that you may simply substitute in ""creative intuition"" or ""muse"" or some such term if you are not comfortable with the religious undertones. For me this was uncomfortable at first, given that I was totally in my rational head, but this sort of leap of faith is just what I needed. Some of the exercises did not apply as well to me, but I can almost always find some benefit, even if small. Many are cathartic. The daily process of the morning pages is both a grueling task and a revelation.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this process for any creative person, no matter what ""level"" you have achieved thus far. There is always room to grow and learn, and this is a provocative and enriching experience."

I was able to install my HP LaserJet 4L as a network printer in both Windows 7 and Linux by simply following the add network printer prompts.  How cool is that!

0,This product is great and works well. It is thick enough to make it hard to throw. If you want to throw a tennis ball then the plastic part should be strong enough to go through it. It is a perfect size for my dogs and is perfect for them. I have 2 dogs with medium to large chests and they have never had problems with this ball. I just put it on them and they go to their feet. It is very easy to put on and take off. The only thing I wish I could do is let them just sit on it and it would be a good thing for them to not have to do that. I would definitely recommend this product. This is the best dog bed I have found. It's lightweight and is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for the last 10 years. It's well made and the only thing that bothers me is the fact that it is a little hard to put on but that's not a problem with the other dog beds I have used. My dogs go to the bed when they're hungry and this one is a little bit tougher on them. This is the only catnip my cat doesn't like.

1,"I grew up watching these TV shows. They were much better than anything we have to suffer through now. These had very little ""Social Justice"" crap in them. These TV shows were fun and entertaining without any ridiculously presented PC. For a buck-ninety-nine the episodes are worth it."
1,"We've all heard the premise before, we all know how it's going to end, but few films take us on such an marvelously silly ride as 'The Other Guys'! This film is played completely for laughs and at no point do you think anything happening is real. It's funny as the only film that came to mind when I watched this movie was Steve Coogan's 'Hamlet 2'(even more hilarious!), which is a different story, but has the same loopy feel. Coogan has a fairly small but intricate role here, but I suspect he helped with the humor or they chose him to be in this because he had the right amount of kookiness they were looking for.

Ferrell has never been funnier and Walberg proves he can do comedy in this farce with a mission to bust your gut! I laughed out loud throughout this crazy flick and it was a welcome change from the standard buddy film. If you're in the mood for supreme goofiness, then 'The Other Guy' will have you laughing hysterically, but if you don't like silly films, then this one might leave you scratching your head."

I don't know how many people were given a pass to read the book, but I did enjoy it. It was great to read about the lives of the young people who were on the train with the New York Yankees. I thought the book was a little hard to read, but it was worth it. I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I am hoping that the book will be better than the first one. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters. I have read many of the book's books. I look forward to the next one. I really enjoyed this book and it was good to see the author take a step back and think about the life of the characters. I think it's a good story and I'm glad I got to see it out. The ending was a bit abrupt but it was nice to see it end. I have a feeling it won't be a repeat of the first two books. I will definitely read another of the series. I will definitely recommend it.

It does not necessarily encourage free thinking and creativity nearly as much as other building toys, but it is a good starter set for that type of thinking.  After done, you are kind of stuck with two big toys that don't do much beyond standard toys that are already built.  Not knocking it really, but just how my kids work.  I think at this price, there should be more creative thinking."

1,"Like the other reviewer, I just got this for the saw. Took advantage of the B&D promo ($10 off 50) which is the cost of the battery, charger, and the Saw alone, it is almost like the drill is just a bonus. I have own the string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, and a drill already and all use this great lithium 20v battery. For over two years, I used one battery for all this tools (still have 2 spare batteries plus another one and 2 chargers) I leave it on the charger and charge it after every uses.

One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.

UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare. I even bought a cheap Harbor Freight metal blade with 10mm arbor just to test and it worked really well for light metal cutting and just left the blade even when cutting wood."

1,"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond."
1,"This DeWalt planer stand is well made and sturdy.  The DeWalt 735x, this stand, and customer support from DeWalt's Ed Ryan, has made me a fan of DeWalt.  For me, this stand would be even better if it had two tool drawers underneath.
  Okay, I just put together my second of these stands for a new drill press.  The fit and finish was consistent with the fine quality of the first one.  Be sure to not fully tighten the top-side supports before putting on the top, or you will have to go back and loosen them all in order to align the top holes with the bolts. This time, I used my Hilti impact driver on setting 1 which made putting this stand together take only 25 minutes."
1,"This 2000 Israeli film is as fresh as today's headlines.  Set in a settlement in Israel it's about a radical rabbi and his ardent followers, two best friends who compete for the rabbi's daughter, and the ongoing conflicts of orthodoxy and secularism in Israel.

The film is as bleak as the landscape around the settlement.  And the rabbi's radicalism is the one thing that keeps the young men bound together.  One of them is in the army and creates a religious unit much to the concern of his superiors who distrust the radicalism, even though the soldiers perform well.  Another young man is the scholar and the rabbi wants him to marry his daughter.  Alas, though, she prefers the soldier.  Trouble follows.  She leaves the settlement and goes to the city where she finds an apartment with some other religious young women.

Her rejection of her religious suitor, however, pushes him to plan to commit a radical act and he involves the soldier as well as another innocent friend in the plan.  How this all plays out is scary, as we are all aware of the potential violence of terrorist attacks.  This film brings this all out as well as some complex psychological factors.

The problem was that the story moved a little two slowly for my taste.  Also, as it was a foreign film, I know that it lost a lot in translation.  It seemed as if some parts were missing and the narrative seemed to jump round awkwardly.  So, in spite of its message and the tension raised regarding what would happen next, I found myself looking at the clock and feeling bored.  However, the film had an interesting theme and the acting was excellent.  It also showed me the world through a unique point of view."

1,"Quiet,strong,handsome,shy when it comes to women, has trouble making decisions and the inability to  say ""NO"" to anyone describe this Hot, Hunky, Cowboy version of a tarnished saint. James Taylor sold his ranch in Texas, ended a 3 year relationship to a women he did not love and came home to raise his horses.  Mindy MacAllister has made mistakes and paid the price.  She wants to find someone who will love her despite of her past and raise a family.  When the Taylor brothers Aunt Cappy talks her into coming home, she jumps at the chance hoping to see the one Taylor brother that has held her heart since she was a child.  Nothing worth wild is easy in life and the budding relationship between the two characters is a prime example of this.  Aunt Cappy's meddling, the other tarnished saints not so helpful help and the past that does not want to stay in the past make for an entertaining reading experience. James has a big heart and a lot of love to give and is the first tarnished saint that I have read about who has an almost perfect halo.  If he could just learn to say no and make decisions he could probably ascend and become the first Taylor saint."

1,"Okay ,Clint Eastwood is brilliant from all sides of the camera.
He also looks great for being almost 80.
The film has a great storyline. Its about an angry old man named walt who just lost his wife and no one cares that he lost his wife, The grandkids make a mockery of his wife's funeral and his son's just shrug it off and kind of think its puzzling that he is so mad at them.
He has every right to be angry,he has lung cancer and hates what is happening to his neighbourhood. a gang of thugs so vicious even the police are afraid of them  have taken over and rape,steal kill and destroy whenever they feel like it. The only who cares beside Walt is a pudgy, young priest who has no idea what he is doing.
So Walt starts taken care of things on his own,he also helps a wimpy kid get it together so he can make it in the world.
I had a problem with movie,Walt is a giant racist. Seriously, every other sentence out of his mouth is some derogatory word for Jews, Blacks,Koreans, Italians, and irish people.

My daughter is 15 months old, 25 pounds and has chubby thighs.
I read many of the reviews saying that this item runs a bit large.  I purchased two sizes since Amazon offers free returns on this item, thinking I would try them on and keep one.

My daughter currently wears 18-24 month clothing.

I purchased two sizes: 18 months and the 2T.

The 18 month size fits her perfectly.  It's not too tight, there is room to grow in both the top and bottom.
The top is cut nice and long, so the bottom of the top sits at on her lower hips.  On my daughter, the hem of the top covers the waist of the bottoms, this helps the top from riding up.
The bottoms fit nicely over swim diapers.

We have used this both at the pool and the spray ground (I have included photos, front and back).
The quality (we have had these for one week) look to be great, the zipper is sturdy and very easy to zip up and down.  I do love how easy it is to get on and off.  One other reviewer did not like the bulk of the zipper, and I can see if the the child is wearing a size that is too large, then the top might ride up and the zipper might be bulky, but we don't have this problem.

I returned the size 2T, which also could have worked nicely, they were not too big and she may have grown into them, but I liked the fit of the 18 month suit a little better."
1,Had to buy 2 and cut to fit since we have a four-foot shower. It doesn't work that well but it's passable. Doesn't anybody make what's needed for these larger showers.
0,We all have preferences and some will be the best. I will admit that I have been tempted to give this book a try but I think that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.

1,"This playset is adorable & definitely playable. If you have a Littlest Pet Shop fan in the family, he or she will love it. My younger daughters are in their early teens now, but have been collecting & playing with Littlest Pet Shop for around 7 years now. They really like this set and are interested in collecting the other Style Set rooms. I like how the Style Sets stack so that they're playable but don't take up as much room. My daughters love to play the LPS app on their Kindles so getting more animals to add is a huge plus for them. Their previous LPS toys coordinate nicely with this set too. What I like is that it can all be stored away in a labeled plastic bin with a lid (I use a clear medium sized Rubbermaid bin), so nothing gets lost.

The one detractor of this set in my eyes, is that it's a little overpriced. Unfortunately most of the LPS toys tend to be overpriced when first released. I usually wait until they go on sale."

1,"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.
Space age looking, and heavier than most standard claw hammers, but easy to use and swing with less shock than a wooden or straight plastic handled hammer.
Like others I have noticed some nicks and scratches after very little uses so suggest the steel is a little softer than it should be maybe.
At nearly $50 this hammer is almost 3 times more expensive than the Estwing steel shaft 16 oz claw hammer, over 2.5 times as much as the excellent Stanley 51-163 16-Ounce FatMax Xtreme AntiVibe Rip Claw Nailing Hammer, and around six times more than a standard hickory handled or fibreglass Stanley. Aside from the magnetic nail channel (great feature) I don't see a huge amount to justify the price. It does have a lifetime warranty, but then again it should at the price. I was generous and gave it 4 stars."

1,"This board is perfect for quick games as well as teaching beginners. The small & light portability is great for grabbing and bringing to a friend's house without lugging in a full-size board (which there's simply no way to do without it coming off like a big grand entrance).

The bottom is covered in felt which is *really* nice. Every other small board I've used it's been a real nuisance to not inadvertently knock the board a bit and mess up where the pieces are. The felt, which seems to be secured reasonably well, gives a perfect amount of grip while retaining a traditional feel.

Finish / grain is nice. It doesn't come off like an oak heirloom, but it doesn't come off like a cheap piece of contact paper either. I think that's precisely the charm of this board - it's a classy but not intimidating introduction - inexpensive but not cheap. Actually at this price I'd be happy to give it to anyone I can get hooked and buy another for myself (any go player in the US will tell you that a live partner is worth far more than the cost of this board!)

Another use for this board: if you are looking at games online (such as at itsyourturn) or studying go books to demystify some of the concepts having a little 9x9 around is great to play out a board position by yourself when you see a shape and are trying to read into which side it will favor, whether it's alive, etc."

1,"It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.  The pad is exceptional for traction or laser.

I currently have two testable units.. a 15""+ PC and 8""+ netbook.  It's great for both, but the larger proves that this desk is the perfect fit as it is invisible once placed.  Usage appeal for me is, ironically, in bed.  I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.  My PC is getting ""older"" and I feel it gets hotter than it should at times, but this is a great remedy.  The hollow core keeps it cooler and safer.  When not in use, I store it easily on my bookshelf, and it takes no room."

1,"First, this ball is very large for a dog toy, like the size of a large grapefruit.  My dog plays with it off and on.  It's proven to be durable, even when he grasps it in his mouth and shakes the living daylights out of it.  (Dog is 70 lbs. pit/yellow lab mix.)

1,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 16 movie version is not legit.  The DVD menus are just a still image.  There is absolutely no copy write information on anything or any warnings...  Each dvd just has a still image with the list of movies at the bottom to select.  I noticed the audio cutting in and out and switching from 5.1 or stereo while watching it, this only happened a few times.  The quality seems to be normal for dvd's.  Keep in mind that everything will look fuzzy on a large HD tv, but that is normal.

That said, I got this for like 30 bucks, and that is an amazing deal considering that these movies are sooo ridiculously overpriced individually.  The Blu Ray version of these movies go for 30-40+ dollars a piece, which is total BS in my opinion.  I definitely recommend this, but don't spend 1 or 200 bucks on this like some people are saying, there are plenty of 30ish dollar copies out there if you look.  There are several listings for this on amazon, do a more general search if you can't find them."

Leatherman has replaced at least 6 of these tools for me with refurbished ones. 4 stars because of the fragile jaws, otherwise I love it and use it multiple times daily."
1,"When this was a lightning deal recently, I couldn't resist getting this for my grandchildren.  I remember playing game after game of Connect Four with my kids when they were young.  I even played it a lot with one daughter when she had to be under a mist tent in the hospital.  It's the only thing that wouldn't fall apart!  Those memories flooded back when one of these big versions was in the waiting room at Texas Children's Hospital.  My grandson had a ball with it while waiting to have his tonsils out.  HE wasn't interested in playing by the rules (he's 3), but he liked putting the discs in and then getting them to drop out.  When he got tired of doing that, he turned the discs into pretend food to use with the kitchen set.

The downside to this is I have had to pick up all of the discs many times as the 3 year olds (he has a twin brother) scatter them every where.  Oh well, that's what kids do.  We are working on getting them to help pick them up.  At least there is a convenient way to store them."

George Ingle Finch was on the 1922 expedition (George W Rodway, editor, George Ingle Finch's The Struggle for Everest, page  200) and this quote, while jingoistic, refers to the amazing accomplishments that came from that small special island in the North Sea:

""The bones of British pioneers lie in the white mountains stretching from the North Pole to the South Pole. These are the milestones of achievement marking the road to the extreme points on our earth, which have always inspired the sons of others nations. After such numerous and terrible sacrifices have been laid down on Everest's altar, is it immodest to wish for a man of our race to be victorious and set foot on the so ardently contested highest point of our earth, the summit of the unapproachable Mount Everest?"""

1,"*I was given a copy of this book as a gift from Stephanie's Book Reports in exchange for an honest review.

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!  This is a book that I would 100% recommend!"

1,"Good news! This not only works with PC and Mac, but also on my Linux. It paired immediately with the speakers I tried. The only drawback (and this isn't the fault of the dongle) was that I had to fiddle around a bit to find out how to select the external speakers rather than the default on-board speakers. So be advised: if you think it's not working, do check your output settings to be sure that it's not a problem with your default selection."

1,"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground. I purchased the 74"" tree and was concerned it might not be tall enough to make the cats feel secure, but it's plenty tall and spacious too!

If you are looking for a sturdy tree that your cat/s will enjoy I recommend this product by Armarkat."

0,"My 4 cats LOVE this toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put together. If you don't get a solid piece, the plastic part will slip off and slip off. I have to drill a hole in the center for it to slide back in. The only way to put it together is to leave it in the car and then put a strong towel over it and just put a nail in it. But if you don't have a good idea of how to do that, you probably won't be able to figure out how to put it together.

Overall, it's a great toy. It's a good size for my two cats. They'll play with it and it's a good size for my 18 lb. Yorkie. I'll be buying another one for when I have to pull it out of the car.

My cats love this toy."

0,"I installed this switch in a standard garage door opener. I chose this one because I was just starting to get into the garage. The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on. The light switch is made of plastic, and the light switch does not come with a case. The light switch has a rubber band that allows it to be removed from the door by removing the plastic band. The light switch is on a low voltage circuit that runs from the battery to the switch. The light switch is a single button on the side of the door, and the switch is made of plastic.

1,"I usually wear a size 36 x 34 in all my jeans regardless of brand, so I ordered accordingly for the Silver Zac jeans. While trying to find my size, I discovered that Silver's official website offers a generic sizing chart, but trying to estimate my exact size was difficult based on the limited information. Anyway, my new 36 x 34 Silver jeans arrived from Amazon and were exactly what I had in mind in terms of color and style. (These jeans look exactly as they do in the pictures on Amazon). However, I immediately noticed after trying them on that these jeans were way too large on me--in the waist, thigh, and leg. I checked the tag and noticed that the jeans are made from 99% cotton and 1% elastane, which means there is a slight amount of stretch in the material. Not necessarily a bad thing, but it certainly made the jeans feel overly baggy. I ordered another pair exactly like the first, but in size 34 x 34. Amazon sent the replacement pair in a scant three days! The new jeans fit perfectly, look great, and are not too tight. Also, the inseam length (34) was appropriate with other 34 inseamed jeans that I wear. If you are looking for a pair of trendy jeans, these are perfect. Just make sure to go down one full size in order to achieve the optimal fit."
1,"This book wasn't too bad, somewhat too short of a read and it does have a cliff hanger. Spoilers ahead. Harley had just been released from prison and headed back to the only place she knew as home. Her father was dead, her brother was bad news, and the only other person she could turn to shunned her. Colt offered for her to stay with him until she could figure things out.
 Grammar and punctuation is good. Characters are not mixed up. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't mind buying the next book."

1,These are the only balls that my dog will play with. I particularly like them because they don't get all wet and slobbery like the tennis balls.  We have tried other chuckit! balls like the one that whistles and glows in the dark and my dog will run after them but not retrieve those for some reason.  They last longer than any other balls that we have bought.  After a while of 2 dogs playing keep away from each other they can crack.  The only thing that would be a negative for me is that I wish you could buy more than 2 in a package.  I have had one stuck in the tree and then go on a trip and leave the other behind and my dog is lost with out his chuckit! ball.
0,"I don't think I've ever read an author with such an extensive history as this, and I'm not sure that I'll ever get a chance to get through it.  The writing is so compelling, and the characters so compelling, that it is hard to put down.  The writing is always a bit too choppy, and I'm not sure if it is a result of the editing or just something that I felt like I was missing.  I don't know, I'm not sure if I'll ever get the chance to read it, but I know that I will.  I loved it.

I really enjoyed the story, and I found it to be a fun read.  It's a bit of a letdown in my opinion.  I think it's a good story, but I think it's not the best book I've read in a long time.  I think the writing was just too choppy"

1,"I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

One star taken off for the price, which seems way too high for what the product consists of."

1,"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling."

I originally bought these to be a part of a Pink hockey team - needless to say it served it's purpose.

It's fantastically light, affordable and the color is super bright.

Highly recommended, if this is your thing."

1,"I finally picked up the black version off of Woot for a great price. The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well."

1,"This blender is excellent!  Engineered well and built well.  I have used a lot of blenders in my life but this one really blends whatever you toss into it. If the lid is not secured properly it will not start (nice feature)!  Lots of power = lots of noise...this has both.  Also, this lower blade is integrated into the pitcher, unlike the other models that screw into the bottom of the pitcher and eventually leak.
Suction cups on the bottom really stick this blender into the counter keeping it from moving...nice touch!

So why not five stars????

Not only does this blender not work with any of the Ninja single blending cup accessories it is not advertised as such.
A call to Ninja confirmed this.
Would be nice if I could use the Ninja single serve blending cups.  The single serve cups allows you to store several days worth of your blended batch into these cups.  The cups can then be placed on the blender and blended individually...(they have a mixing blade on each cup).  If you want this option you need to order the BL830."

1,"Installed easily. Just plugged it into a USB port and Windows 7 recognized it. I should have stopped there. Instead, I installed the driver on the included mini-disk. The driver installed easily, but once it was installed, Skype no longer recognized it. I uninstalled the driver - no joy. I restored my computer to pre-driver installation, no joy. I tried installing the most recent driver from their web site. The installation never finished. I kept getting messages that Windows didn't recognized the publisher, and as soon as the progress bar was full, it started all over again. I tried uninstalling the updated driver and I got messages that something was already running, and it wouldn't uninstall. I have sent Ausdom an email asking for help, but I am returning it if I don't get an immediate, helpful response. My OS is Windows 7, and it is completely up to date.

Right now, it seems the only way to get this software off my system is to completely rebuild it, and I'm not looking forward to doing that."

1,This faucet is a piece of junk. It worked fine for the first six weeks that we had it. And then it started leaking in multiple places - after the ability to return it to Amazon for a refund expired. All Pfister will do is send us a replacement part.

1,"I was really surprised at the size and weight of this watch! I got it for my son who is very athletic, but he's not a big man! Tall, slender and fit...YES, but not bear-sized like one of the reviewers. :-) I feared that he wouldn't like it because of the size, but he certainly allayed that worry. He told me he even wore it while playing soccer and it was comfy, which surprised everyone.

Anyway, it's perfect for him and he loves it. We both agree that it's very attractive and sturdy. The green on the face adds just the right amount of eye-appeal without being flashy.

Truthfully, my son and I got into how ""pretty"" it is and how sports friendly, completely forgetting to comment on the accuracy of the time-piece...which is what any watch is all about, of course. :-) Well, when we finally got around to that, I learned that it's perfectly accurate. But with the INVICTA name, I'm not surprised.

No review of this watch would be complete without mentioning the packaging! You'd expect something like the Hope Diamond to be packaged like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invicta-Men-s-6566-Subaqua-Noma-IV-Collection-Chronograph-Black-Polyurethane-Watch/dp/B004PJ1J4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invicta Men's 6566 Subaqua Noma IV Collection Chronograph Black Polyurethane Watch</a>&nbsp;comes in a jeweler's quality, bright-yellow box with a hinged lid and... Oh, it's just too lovely to describe... I hope you can get this and see for yourself.

Do study the manual that comes with it; makes it easier to understand the little intricacies of this phenomenal product.

Nothing else to say except that this is an amazing watch! Expensive, but well worth it because it's an upgrade from the other diver's watches on the market. Amazon's price can't be beat. (I saw the same brand at T.J. Maxx and even with their discount, it was much more than this.)

1,"This version of Risk has you fighting for control of middle earth.  There are four sets of armies to chose from gold and green are the Alliance of Elves and Men while red and black are the armies of Mordor.  The this version of risk adds in generals, strongholds and the fellowship of the ring movie along to Mount Doom; all of these can be optional of course.  Generals and strongholds add one to the players highest roll, so if you are defender being attacked and you territory has a stronghold in it then your 6 becomes a 7.  If you are an attacker and have a general in the territory you are attacking from then your 6 becomes a 7.  Now the playing with the fellowship of the ring then they begin in Shire and move you terroritory per turn till they reach Mount Doom.  If the fellowship lands in a terroritory controled by the forces of Mordor then they can roll to capture the fellowship and thus win the game, but if the fellowship reaches Mount Doom then the forces of Mordor loose.  Beyond these additions this game play like normal Risk.  Overall this a fun version of Risk and if you love both Risk and LOTR then this is a must buy."

This stuff can be made a mess pretty easily with a crappy blade.  The 80T did a wonderful job on the ply and solid materials.  Almost no tear out/splintering on the ply and the cuts on the solid stock where beautiful.  This blade cuts as well as my $150 Tenyru.  Time will tell how well/long it stays sharp.  Will post more info in a few weeks.

UPDATE.....been using the blade for a couple of weeks.  Still sharp.  The thing that sets this blade apart, and all good blades, is the ability to cut small amounts from small mouldings and leave them laying on the table rather than sending them off like a missle.  This blade has not thrown anything yet!  Will be purchasing another one as a back up."
1,"Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone."

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!"

1,"Maybe its wicked but Alexa Rileys stories are like a fairy tales, only for adults. Kinky, steamy, and naughty fairy tales. And who does not like a good tales before bedtime?

The blurb really say it all. Alexander bought land with mansion on it, where he wants to build a airstrip for his plane. He is determined workaholic and wants to tear down the house. But when he comes and sees the angel in there, his plans must change dramatically. Liliana was alone in the house after the death of her grandmother. Alexanders arrival sees as a miracle, she was waiting for him that he would come and save her.

Its like a prince on a white horse comes to free the princess. On the one hand, innocent and pure heroine, and on the other posessive and barbaric hero. Its love at first sight, so sweet, completely irrational and even more sinful. We can always count on described in detail steaming scenes, and here even though it is very short, there is not lack of them.

1,"I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these."

1,"This book presents an overwhelming topic in a very non-overwhelming way.  Ten year-old Akilah finds her best friend changed when she comes back from a summer trip to Nigeria to visit her grandmother and go through a ""coming of age ceremony.""  Eventually her friend confesses that her parents took her to an illegal doctor to be circumcised.  Akilah promises not to tell anyone, but these things have a way of getting told.

Akilah tells the story from the eyes of a child, but this book is not meant for children.  It could serve as a gentle introduction to the idea of Female Genital Mutilation or as a lesson in human rights to middle school students.  There is an after word by the author including more facts about FGM and an invitation for kids to email her their thoughts.  I would be interested in the sorts of emails she has gotten.

Williams-Garcia borders on overly didactic, but the tone of the book and the friendship between Akilah and Victoria save it from becoming overly so.

I highly recommend this book to girls age 12 and up."

1,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel. For fans of YA fantasy adventures about a teenage boy, this story is a recommended read.

The only thing I can say is that I am a huge fan of the Tuckers. I love that they are so realistic and in the moment they are there for each other. I love how the authors always keep their characters real. I love how the story is told from the perspective of each of the characters. It is so easy to see what is going on in their heads. I love how they are able to get their feelings for each other, and how they keep it real.

I enjoyed the writing and the characters. I liked the way the characters kept their personalities to themselves and their relationships. I loved the fact that the author does not give up on the story and how it is told. I also liked how the author does not give up on the book.

1,"This has been one of my personal favorites of the McGee series. Travis is hired by a very famous movie star who is being blackmailed due to some photos that show her, in the old-fashioned phrase, in compromising positions. (With more than one guy). The novel was written before you could send pictures on cell phones. McGee must track down the members of the wild party and find out which one is the blackmailer. It's a very good plot as McGee studiously eliminates suspects. And finds some have died and some, possibly, murdered.
  McGee's love interest in this novel is the movie star's secretary who accompanies him on his travels. The reason given for this doesn't really hold up but, hey, she's essential to the plot.
  It was another firstrate Travis McGee novel."

Like I said, my kids don't watch Family Guy, but they loved this little Time Machine and the Stewie figure.  They think its cool to have built a time machine, even if it is just pretend.  I will say this set does not hold together too well to play with, we had issues with the door coming off, but maybe that was just our building issues.  Oh and it was kinda weird that the back piece is cardboard and not K'NEX plastic pieces.

1,"It's always fun to find a new author to enjoy!  This second in the BBB series was just as good as the first book.  Both leads were very likeable, the secondary characters were fabulous, and the storyline flowed smoothly with easily solved conflicts.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats. Now I guess it's time to admit that I stopped reading several, ok - lots of, times to 'refresh my memory' LOL!"

1,"Desperately needs a backlight so you don't need a flashlight to read it when used in a dark corner. The user interface is clumsy but can be figured out.

Are you listening P3?  It would also be nice to have a 15A/20A version for measuring microwave ovens, dishwashers and such.  Put a 20A receptacle on the front. When using with a 20A outlet, just rotate the blade sideways on the back and plug it in.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.  Let's see, one to track the refrigerator, one for the entertainment center, a 220v one that is on the A/C circuit, one for the clothes dryer, a hardwired one for the kitchen oven and one on the furnace.  Every yuppie in California will have to have a full-house system."

OMG Ashley Beale is an amazing author. Her books are captivating, complex and full of suspense. I had a hard time putting down until the very end. The chemistry between these two was so intense.

1,"I am crushed because I LOVED this book, and looked forward to the movie since I read it when it came out!  I am crushed because despite the anger I have I liked the move but I am crushed because I also hated it!  The story is supposed to be about Voldemort (and the mystery of the half-blood prince), getting harry prepared to face things, in one of these ways letting him get to know his enemy and his origins through memories (the relationships between characters is important  just not as important to the story as EVERYTHING they left out!, and other relationships Harry forms are important too but these characters such as dobby never really appear in the movies after they are introduced in one of them...)The director that did this movie is a MORON, and they should be forced to film all the missing story gaps and a few more memories and re-release the movie and if not that at least film all of the stuff and extend the movie on blu-ray by at LEAST 30 minutes!  The movie makes no sense, even my wife who had not read the books said it feels incomplete and half-made...  I hate that they cut out the battle at the end of the book too, oh yea we'll just strut out  of the castle...  The director destroyed the heart and soul of this book by taking the MAIN story line out, and lightening it up! I am surprised J.K. Rowling did not step in and say NO you ruined my book!  I am severly upset about this!  They need to be forced to fix this!"

I was particularly interested in this book because it details a typical Houdini murder, a murder that takes place in a small village in the eastern part of the island. This murder is still haunting me for the rest of my life. I will read it again and again and again.

I also enjoyed reading about the scene of the killer's haunting and the ghost town. It's very sad that Houdini is gone, but the ghost town is still haunting me. I also liked the description of the building, and the people that live there. I love the way that the island is filled with people that are different and different from the other people in the island. It's a wonderful read and I recommend it to everyone.

1,"The Silver magic series is perhaps my favorite by this author. And this second book is the natural follow-up to the first. Everyone's favorite Dees from the first book, Glass, here has her chance to try life as a human. And she quickly lands herself in a heap of trouble, along with a romantic intrigue.

This book features the same imaginative inventiveness as the first book, and the same colorful characters. The Dees are wonderful as always. But the author's most brilliant characters, in my mind, are the Brothers Grimm. metaphysical hit men who live by their own convoluted code. This pair is calling for their own book. But let's get back to the book at hand, which is grand enough in it's own right.

I don't want to reveal too much, but if you thought the Dees were magnificent in defense of the Howard mansion, just wait until you see them turned loose in this book."

1,"When the author approached me for a review, I instantly liked the idea of a book that celebrates the uniqueness and specialness of your baby. This one is illustrated by hand drawings similar to those on the front cover. So there is a drawing and a sentence or so about that step in the story. Then another picture and another sentence. You'll see what I mean in the Look Inside.

It's very short which is why the best I can give is 4 stars, for the lovely idea. The story could be significantly expanded and a little attention to some of the wording would also be helpful."

The other books were very good, but the story was lacking.  The main character, Daisy, is a very good-looking, sweet, determined, independent woman who had a hard time with her mother.  She's a sweetheart and a strong woman, but she's also a great friend.  She's also a beautiful, determined woman, but her heart is a bit broken.

1,"My doc has been after me to use Hibiclens for a chronic skin problem I've been suffering with.. Problem was I couldn't afford it.  So being a rather resourceful person, I figured it out.  If a Vet. grade product that is used on animals is safe, and it is the same basic chemical as Hibiclens (without all the dyes and perfumes) then what the heck do I have to worry about?  So I tried it, and it worked. But the real test came when I went back to my doc and told her that although I could not afford Hibiclens, I got a Vet. Grade product of chlorhexidine and used it.  Her response? She smiled and gave me a thumbs up!  In other words folks, if this stuff is safe for Fluffy it's safe for you too.  That is, as safe as any chemical might be.  Use your head, read, dilute the stuff (one ounce per gallon). Don't get it in your ears and eyes and please first mention it to your doc that you intend on doing this. They are the professionals, and if it's not good for you they will say so.  Always check with your doc. And I don't mean Dr. Google."

1,"Brilliant white with a small, subtle logo on the left chest instead of that old big logo some brands use. The seams and edging all around this shirt are well sewn and smooth, no seconds here. The v-neck style is actually cut too low for my husband's taste, he said it looks like some of my v-neck t-shirts - as in too feminine for him.

The shirt does run small though and despite not liking the v-neck, he would wear it anyway if it fit right. It's a little narrow in the shoulders for him and fits more like a small. Compared to the medium t-shirts in other brands, this one is cut differently. On the plus side, it fits me fine and the fabric is very soft, but he's right, that v is feminine."

1,"I have a massive crush on the Alaskan lifestyle, landscape and people. This is one of the best memoirs I have read about adventures in the fierce Alaskan world. When his cousin, living out in the Alaskan Bush, invites him to visit and assist in building a cabin, Campbell can't turn down the offer. In fact, he decides to take his eldest daughter, Aidan, a young teen, along. The two make three separate and unforgettable trips, which are narrated in this story. Awe, beauty and danger everywhere, he's written it in a way that allows the reader to be right there on the trips. The only thing that could have made this story better was if we had learned first hand how his daughter viewed the trips. Wonderful adventure for the armchair traveler or Alaskan dreamer."
1,"My 3 year old enjoys many things, running, playing ball, he loves cars, he loves play food, play cooking and feeding the dog play food. (The poor dog!) When Learning Resources sent us the New Sprouts Cook It! My Very Own Chef Set to review and my son was really excited to get busy playing with it.

The Cook It! Set is a 6 piece set with easy to hold handles that are safe for small hands, it contains a  skillet, a pot, a lid, a colander and 2 serving spoons. It is a great way for little ones to pretend they are cooking without damaging Moms nice cookware. As you can see in the photo, my son was too excited to start cooking and he took off with the pot and colander as soon as they came out of the package.

I really like that this play set compliments his play food well. It is just the right size to pretend to cook with. It is durable and easy to keep clean, and it is the perfect size for storing without taking up too much space.

The Cook It! Set encourages imaginative play and it teaches kids to be nurturing.  Whenever my son pretends to cook something for me I praise him and thank him, he feels special and helpful and this is teaching him to think of others and to be helpful while he is having fun in the process.

I have been very pleased with this play set. I like the bright colors, I love that my sometimes too rough son has not been able to damage it and that he is learning every time he plays with it."
1,"I really liked American Mary and it could have been a stellar film if the writers had paid a little more attention to the story and the plot - subplots they laid out.
Why the detective isn't immediately checking out the strip club Mary frequents is ludicrous considering everything else he knows about the case, and why after years of these rape parties hosted by the elite doctors of this university no one has spoken up is a pretty damn big stretch.
And what was that bizarre ""romance"" between the strip club owner and Mary? It seemed quite the afterthought.

All that aside, the look of the film, the effects, the acting and the plastic surgery disasters (Betty Boop and Barbie) are superb. Disturbing and effective creations indeed."

1,"At first I thought this book was taking place along time ago, because being from the USA, it's hard to think women are not even close to being equals with men,  in many parts of the world. It was shocking when the story was talking about planes and phones, that I got a wake up call this was a romance story for now. I personally thought  Hajar's reaction to his trauma was right on. People had a hard time looking at him, so of course, he would feel like the beast. I also liked the spunk of Katherine. My heart ached for her, on the reaction of her father, just because she was a women. I truly can't believe this book is free, I liked it that much. There is love making, but not the erotica type. The romance builds, which I also liked, they just don't fall head over heels for each other and have sex right away."
1,"We like this electronic version alright. The convenience of the cards and electronic banking make game play faster and smoother, but this game is very different. Life tiles have been replaced with action cards and the action cards are so different. They may say something like ""Have a dance contest with another player."" and both will spin the wheel and highest number takes the prize. With younger children this will be great. I imagine they will enjoy it and the focus on family bonding for this version is awesome. However for just adults playing it's a bit too young. Also the values are crazy. I believe there's a card that says throw uncle max a birthday party pay 50K! Must have been some party! Obviously the older versions had exaggerated prices but this one is even more so. The only real complaint I have is that mine came in a cheap and very thin cardboard box with flaps, not in a shoe box style box like most board games. Ours has already ripped and we now keep the game in a basket."
1,"Received this for an honest review...Tanner is amazing to me. He is giving Natalie intimacy when he said he didn't know how. I love how Natalie is finding out about herself. She is exploring her own desires and sexuality as a woman. You should not be embarrassed about your sexuality and any fantasies that you have and by the end of this book, I think she came to terms with that. Tanner of course helps her with her self discovery. Her passion excites him and it just brings them closer together. Can't wait for the next one. Only two left. I'll be sad when it ends. Have enjoyed the journey with Tanner and Natalie!!!"

1,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had to laugh at the antics of the main character, Aiden, to woo Katie over. He was relentless in getting her to admit that she loved him and wanted to be with him. But through it all he knew Katie better than she knew herself it seemed. He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.

I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances. You never know what secret that might have and it could surprise you. I thought the book was well written and seemed to be one of the better books so far in the series.

Overall I enjoyed this book and cant wait to read the next one in the series to see how the other characters fared."

1,"I over all like Panasonic products a lot and have been happy with them. This rice cooker is, however, different. The flawed design is that this one does not have an holder to collect the steam water that runs off the cover when you open the cooker. The water just collect at the rim on the edge. When water is too much or you do not give it time to evaporate on its own, it drains down. One of the danger is that it drains down to the electric socket located at the bottom of the cooker. I returned it because of this poor design, it can cause a short circuit. Please note that not every time the water will drain down that far or it will drain into the socket head on, but for me it is too much a chance to take."

1,"Snapbridge is a joke bordering on fraud.  I ordered the camera and waited 8 months for delivery in order to take wildlife photos.
The remote control was vital to my work.  Spent and entire day trying to get remote control to work.  I was using an I-phone 6s and all the latest software and it wanted a wifi connection as well as bluetooth.  Either one did not work.  I am debating whether to keep the camera because it looks cool and I hope that Nikon will get its act together someday.  It is sad to see the depths to which a fine company like Nikon has sunk to.  Zoom does not properly focus so pictures appear fuzzy.  Nikon said the first delay of 3 months was caused by the earthquake and then another 5 month delay because of ""software issues"" which they obviously did not work out.  If i made claims in my business like Nikon made in selling me this camera I would be in jail for fraud."

1,"We've had this two years now.  We use it sporadically, so perhaps 80-100 oranges in those two years.  It is plastic and it was $20, but somehow it does not seem cheap (pieces fit well, plastic is strong).  But no issues or no complaints so far.  Nothing has broken, and it just works.  Obviously I have not put it through the ringer and it would probably not stand up to heavy use.  It most certainly gets 4-5 stars in the $20 category.  One reviewer complained about batteries....unit plugs in, no batteries, so at least 1 false negative review.

1,"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

INITIAL LOOSE FIT REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED COMFORT!

So it's OK if you have a loose fit with it. It will shrink over time. Very happy all around with this purchase."
1,"This is the only sequel to place the central figure, Prof. Horatio Smith(Leslie Howard), (Scarlet Pimpernel re-incarnate) a century and then some years in the future. Yet, knowing this, this meticulously restored yarn stands entirely alone in thought-provoking suspense, cat-and-mouse deception and thought. Cambridge Prof. Smith is traveling through Germany in wartime with a handful of students while a mysterious man rescues endangered scientists, intellectuals. Are they connected and how? The way Leslie Howard embodies this earlier Indiana Jones archaeologist so completely with all the thrills of his original Scarlet Pimpernel (disguises/surprises) yet takes on fully the seriousness of the Nazi threat to humanity with witty and thought-provoking dialogue places this above most WWII yarns. Added to the Gestapo pressures is an added tension of a cagey female (Mary Morris) pursuer seeking the identity of this war-time savior. The polished script by Leslie Howard is fantastically photographed making this a compelling lustrous addition to the WWII spy genre. A final monologue directed to the Gestapo is as valid today as it was in the 40s."
1,"I got the ash grey pair from Zumiez at my local small. I wanted to try some on in person so I would know what size to get when I order from Toms.com or here in the future. I had to try on a few different sizes, but ended up settling for a half-size down from what I usually wear. When you try them on, keep in mind that they're going to be almost uncomfortably tight. Give it time. I wore mine for a full day, then when I put them on the second day, they stretched enough so they slipped on my feet, and they're perfect. I feel like I'm getting away with something when I wear these."

1,"I have always been fond of Roku and still use the first version they produced.

The setup is incredibly easy, though I don't understand how it would work without a computer.  The device upgrades itself fairly often, which is nice.  I can't believe how small this newest version is, but I like it.  I think it is similar in size to a full size computer mouse. I have no issues with video quality, with the exception of some bumpy Netflix experiences, but that's not a Roku issue.  I have convinced a few of my non-sports viewing friends to get rid of their cable completely and just use Roku.  Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu Plus are my favorite channels, but I explore the other options every once in a while.  I don't use Pandora only because I don't have decent speakers on my television, but would certainly enjoy it if my sound situation improves.  It would be perfect for background music during parties/game nights.

I love Roku and can't think of a single negative aspect."
1,We got this for my daughters first birthday and she loves it. It's hard to take her out of it. Arrived with no scratches and in excellent condition.
1,"This novel is so real.  There is nothing farfetched or out of this world that happens.  Everything is completely plausible and even probable.  The story itself is emotional and heartfelt.  It is in essence a story about overcoming the worst of hardships, yet it is so much more.  Harrisons understated, mellow, yet still vivid descriptions craw you into the world that shes created.  Her use of the real as opposed to the worst case scenario makes it easy to relate to, thus incorporate yourself into, the story.  I definitely feel like Ive set foot in Oz after reading this tale.

The characters were amazing as well.  I really appreciate how strong and independent the main character was.  She also was less than perfect, allowing readers to relate to her on a personal level, because you do get to know her quite well.  The supporting cast in this novel is divided into 2 groups:  those who are verging on main character status and those who help propel the story forward.  The first group are extremely well developed, becoming individuals that you feel youve met in the real world.  The second group has a range of development that pertains directly to their role in the story.  Overall, Harrison has created a brilliant cast to carry her story forward.

Final thoughts?  I definitely cant wait to dig into more by this talented author.  However, I must say that I was dying for an Aussie Shiraz by then end of the novel.  Be warned!

Please note that I received this novel free of charge from the author in exchange for an honest review."
1,"It gets rid of mold in no time. The only problem though, is the smell. It smells like highly concentrated bleach. Make sure you air the room well or you'll be smelling it for a couple of days.

The mold goes away for good and the best part is that it does not come back. I tried it on my bath tub, right on the edges were the pink and black mold builds up, it got rid of it and never came back. I wonder though, where does the mold go? Because after you spray it, you don't see any residue at all."
1,"Awesome movie.  I've always been a fan of the conspiracy movies made in this era (Marathon Man, Three Days of the Condor, The Conversation among the best) and The Parallax View does not disappoint.  While the scene where Beatty pays for a plane ticket while actually seated on the plane certainly reflects a different time, the race to determine the source of the conspiracy and underlying tension of the scenes is palpable.  A young Beatty without all the mannerisms of his future self carries the film with a strong supporting cast including Hume Cronyn.  Unlike many movies in this genre, the conspiracy doesn't consume the acting."

1,"I have many different sets of scrubs. I do not wear them professionally, I just wear them as pajamas and lounge wear around the house because they are so comfortable and they look a bit better than sitting around in pjs. I am always looking for new sets to add into my collection, and when I saw the MediFit Men's Basic Solid 2 Piece Top and Bottom Scrub Uniform Set, I jumped at the chance to order a set.

MediFit is one of my favorite brands for scrubs. Their quality is high and their pricing is generally lower than other brands. This set was just as good as all of the other MediFit scrubs that I have purchased. The fabric is soft and comfortable against my skin. It is made from 80% Polyester and 20% Tetron Rayon, and it is highly absorbent and wrinkle resistant, which are both definite bonuses! The fabric is also quite breathable and feels light and airy. It would be ideal for someone rushing back and forth in a hospital or doctor's office.

This set of scrubs is very roomy and it has a flattering v-neckline. The top has a roomy patch pocket, and the pants have two slash pockets, and two cargo pockets, so there is plenty of pocket space for me! The waist is drawstring, which means it can fit a pretty wide range of sizes, and the pant legs are a standard straight leg fit. The scrubs have a nice classic design, which I appreciate. I am pleased with their quality and appearance.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!"

1,"Sorry can't give a good review when the product you get is different than what is shown in the photos. Tri legs are a standard in photography because they add stability compared smaller 4 leg base. Why would Fotodiox change this to a 4 leg design is beyond me. Also why have they not updated the photos, could it be because they know most photographers will look at other products if they do. It's nice that the legs fold but poor design that putting the spigot on the the top leg takes away the ability to fold the legs for storage and transport. It seems the early positive reviews are from before Fotodiox changed the product without updating the description or photos."

1,"I LOVE that they sealed the bottom of this warmer! My last one was a gift and it lasted nearly 5 years... but the mice like to get in under the heater in winter (no duh, right?) and this fall, when I went to plug it in, the wires had been chewed. The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky..."

1,"I went and saw this in theaters and then bought the DVD and i have to say it is a awesome movie full of action and suspenseful moments. Then lets not forget Paula Patton in a dress that will make the eyes on any guy widen while he utters the word WOW! I still nearly drool at that point in the movie. MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunts will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which means you won't walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movies will change your view on life. It won't make you do much thinking like other fairly recent films like Inception but then if you use Inception as your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movies quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good. The plot is simple like many action movies but the on-screen things like action and dialog make up for it. Then the car  with a Heads Up Display is in one word is awesome...

4/5 Stars Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies."

So, now I'm on track with it, and it couldn't have come at a better time, because fleas have been rampant this year in the mid-Atlantic that I've seen some feral kitens die because of the infestation.

1,Have had this drill for about 4 years.  Carried in my pickup for quick repairs on family jobs.  Have now gone through 4 sets of batteries (8).  Batteries last only a few months and then show to be defective.  I expected more from Ridgid.  I finally chunked the two drills and  changed to a Dewalt 18V.  Single unit with 2 batteries.  A bit larger but so much more power and after 6 months the Dewalt Batteries still going good.  Would recommend something besides a Ridgid if even knowing the problem with its batteries Ridgid continues to put their name on these CRAP Batteries.
1,"This film reminded of ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle."" George Harriman (Lou Felder) a poorly developed character has been terminated from his fictional movie company for embezzling and to top it all off he might go to prison. Like any white collar criminal faced with ""hard"" time in a federal pen, he opts to do the honorable thing and shoot his family and himself...except for some reason he omits his daughter who is a nurse (Lisa Zane as Laura Harriman ).

When George's former boss Bob (Michael Fairman) hears about it he goes catatonic, like Ned seeing the Mexican Staring Frog of Southern Sri Lanka (South Park season 2). Laura assumes a new identity to infiltrate the home as a nurse so she can bump off Bob's family in front of him.

The terror and acting were both lame. Except for the rare F-bomb, this could have been a made for TV movie. Perhaps my biggest disappointment was right after I obtained this film I discovered it was available in a multi-film pack for the same price.

Rare F-bomb, no sex or nudity. What this movie really needed was for Demi Moore to play the lead with a token shower scene and a little more success and creativity in killing off relatives."

You will root for this couple to find their HEA. I look forward to reading more books by this author."

1,"I love this story. All the characters and the experiences really hit me. My heart hurt when the characters were in pain and I was so happy when they were experiencing joy. I love that you become immersed and invested in all the minor characters. You want to know about them and what's going on with them through their Wishwell experience.

I loved Maddy so much. On the surface she's just a regular privileged teen but through the relationship she has with her neighbor Rachel and her family you see that she's so much more than that. She's smart and strong even when she's sad and weak.

I loved the moments in between the family. This family is full of completely different people with completely different personalities but they are all united through their love for Astrid. You can tell that each one of them would drop everything for Astrid, and that's exactly what they do when they head out on this Wishwell trip.

I fell completely in love with the concept of snow globe moments. It reminds you to always be present in the experiences while you're in them and to always look for adventure and joy."
1,"One of my favorite things to teach in kindergarten is shapes.  There are so many different things you can do with shapes.  MyIMG_0404 students love to learn the shapes as well.  I was very excited to receive the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set from Learning Resources for review.

My students LOVED this activity set.  It was in my small group centers for a couple of weeks.  They kept asking for it.  There were a lot of things that they liked about it.  They loved that they were like puzzles, especially since the mats are the shapes of bugs.  The boys especially loved this fact.  My students loved how brightly colored the shapes were and that there were many different shapes to play with.

As a teacher, there were many things I liked about the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set.  I loved the variety of shapes that are included.  I really like that the shapes are transparent.  This way the students can easily see if they have placed the shape correctly.

I really loved the variety of activities on the cards.  Some of the activities on the cards are placing the shape where it goes, combining shapes to make other shapes, and sorting the shapes by similar and different attributes.  These are things tShapes Don't Bug Me Collagehat students are required to learn in the kindergarten core curriculum.  I love that these activities applied directly to what my students are learning in class.

Most of all, I loved that my students loved to play with them.  I loved that the students were having fun but were learning as well!

This activity set would be great to have at home.  It teaches important shape concepts and the kids will love playing with it!  I loved the Shapes Dont Bug Me Geometry Activity Set and highly recommend it!

1,"I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books."
1,"I wasn't bothered by ""Extremely Dangerous'"" obvious borrowing of a central premise from ""The Fugitive."" It was the lack of suspense and surprises that got to me. I expected a thrill ride of a movie, but it never materialized over the long 3-hour 20-minute DVD.

Obviously, the script is the greatest weakness here. In terms of suspense or mystery, it is a total flop. None of the clues amount to much, you can see the supposed plot twists a mile away, and the villains are easy to spot.

The worst part was how the scriptwriter got the protagonist out of scrapes -- much like an old-time serial, there is even a scene where he dives into the water and is surrounded, seemingly without escape. Then, fade out. Fade in to Sean Bean back at his apartment. How he managed to escape is never shown or explained!

What I assume was the lack of much of a budget seems evident by other odd choices. In one scene, a skyscraper is said to be burning to the ground, but instead of seeing any part of it, we're told about it (with the sound effect of sirens in the background). A low budget is not always a liability, if it spurs creativity, which was not the case here.

What might have made this bearable -- an interesting main performance -- is not forthcoming from Bean. He exhibits no range or subtlety. That leaves the interesting bits to supporting actors -- in particular, Nitin Ganatra as a Pakistani cab service operator. His scenes crackle, but little else in the movie does."

1,"So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from. The zip ties used to secure the hose are tight. I'm pretty dissatisfied after spending about $100"

The only criticism I have is over the daughter, Letty who is said to be 14 years in this book (but was 15 in Invisible Prey? Hmm...children do not grow younger as time passes). I found her to be WAY too mature for her age and I'm really hoping that Sandford doesn't consider her a lead character in future books. I did like the references and appearances of past characters like Del and Virgil (can't wait for a new Virgil Flowers book!). The dialog and banter was fun. I recommend this book. Sandford is one of the best writers out there. Good to see Davenport hasn't lost his edge."

The only reason I ordered this is because I had a lot of leftover junk in the wallet, so I decided to return it.

1,"I ran accross this one by suprise at the store, and Being a carlin fan, it was a no brainer.  Carlin has many great HBO specials over the years, but this one definitly is getting towards probably one of is last.  Carlin unfortunately really is starting to show his age, but his opening rant was great.  But from their the jokes were ok, solid for a few good laughs and moments, but not as memorable as many of his past performaces, and nothing that will stick like them either. HE has so much work, at some point you expect a bit of a let off.  But, it was good to see him out still doing it. Although his political correctness is probably the worst ever, what do you expect, it's Carlin.  Check it out, worth watching, especially if you are doing a Carlin marathon..this one is more like a warm up act, then break out some of his classics and you have a funny evening with a great comic legend of our day."

1,"This is a great lamp with clean simple lines and an attractive brushed steel finish. What I like best is how it's totally stable yet has a very small footprint. The flat base is heavy and totally sturdy and only about a third of an inch thick. Since other objects on your desk or bedside table can sit on the flat base or the base can slip under other things, it effectively takes up almost no space. I got one of these for my bedside table four or five years ago and like it so much I just bought two more. The small ""handle"" (short bar) attached to the head is the only thing about it that strikes me as potentially at all flimsy, and it's not really necessary. I can adjust the angle of the neck easily with one hand. Most of the time the 25watt is plenty bright and I don't need 50watt very often. I'd prefer a switch I can push on-and-off on the lamp itself to the wheel switch that's attached partway down the power cord, but it's not a big deal. A switch on the base or the arm would require them to be thicker and spoil the simple design, so I keep the five stars. I got this lamp after I was disappointed with several cheaper (potentially dangerous) halogen desk lamps bought at local stores and swore I'd never buy a cheap one again. You can find halogen desk lamps that are a lot cheaper and you can find ones that are a lot more expensive, but I haven't seen one yet that's a better value for the price."

1,"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for a honest review.

As American as apple pie! I have been getting into Sports romances here lately ever since I read Pucked By: Helena Hunting, while Rage does not have quite the comedic timing it is still an engrossing read. I love baseball, even grew up playing it myself with my friends so I have a soft spot for anything to do with the sport. AJ is the main character and while he's a bit of a hot head he's an awesome player both on the field and off if you catch my drift ;)

Until he hits the major leagues his temper has controlled his career but after a coach takes him under his wing and along the way he introduces  AJ to his granddaughter who is adorable! And leads to me changing my opinion of AJ, he's great with Clair and eventually meets her mother Addison. . . He makes a stellar first impression let me tell you! Acting like a Grade A . . . Well you know haha but he makes a huge turn around.

I really enjoyed this book, the characters were so well done and the author built up enough intrigue and tension between Addison and AJ that it made for a natural progression. Not like some where they meet and within the first couple of chapters they are falling into bed. I like that she was cautious of beginning a relationship because of Clair it made her a good momma which is one of my favorite character traits of hers. There are some twists and turns in this story that I didn't quite anticipate and that made me want to pick up everything Elizabeth writes from now on. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy sports romances!"

Robert Ludlum mixed with Tom Clancy and Webb Griffin., with the added science fiction/science fantasy elements.
At the same time, actually based on the various ideas floated before the onset of World War II.
A remarkable effort."

No, Really what I mean to say is that this is a great product. Charizard is one of my favorite Pokemon. I love the promo card and the oversized version of it.

With R Burton and E Taylor playing opposite, and caught on film, there was simply no reason to try it again.  I still wonder when anyone does.

1,"I'm a bit late with this review. I've had this watch for almost 2 years and I love  it!! I had been wanting a white ceramic watch for the longest time. I wanted a Michael Kors one but I always hear how delicate they are and you have to be extra cautious with them- the slightest slam on a surface will make it break. My aunt got this watch with the Rose Gold frame and she wears it daily with no problems so I got myself one. Even though this watch is much cheaper than an MK watch it's so durable and worth it. I haven't had any problems with the quality.
The only negative thing I have to say is I have had for less than 2 years and I had to get the battery changed once but I figure it's been running since before I purchased it so it's a minor complaint. I just got it changed within the month so I'll see if it's lasts more than 2 years this time like it should."

1,"My primary use for this toolbox is to keep inside of my truck.

I bought this product to replace my 19"" steel tool box that was your basic, tray ontop and storage below.  I never used a cantilever box before but i thought i could make good use of its space to keep my tools organized.

This toolbox really let me organize a lot more that i thought it would. I put all my ""everyday"" tools in the top 2 compartments. 1 side has a variety of screwdrivers and utility knives and the other side has adjustable wrenches, pliars and ratchets. In the middle compartments I used for my ""Special"" tools, 1 side has alan keys, tin snips, and the other side has my star screwdriver set and extra star bits. In the bottom compartment i have all my racthet sockets, a grease gun, a tool wrap with wrenches and a plastic storage box with bolts/screw/nuts.

The construction of the box is great, the paint job is profession grade. Smooth operation for opening and closing.

With the box closed (handles together) you can access the 2 top compartments just by flicking them open, really nice feature. You can also put a simple clip to keep them from opening on their own, or even a small lock if you'd like.

The item was shipped in its own manufacturer's box inside of another standard brown box.

I highly suggest this box to anyone that has tools and wants to keep them organized in one spot. There is a lot of room in this box and they made it the right size for things like long sockets to stand up next to eahother insted of stacking them ontop of eachother. I can look in my box and see exactly what i need and where it is. No more moving stuff around to get at the tool that I need.

I plan on looking into more of excel's products."
1,"Having had to sit through the ""horror"" films that the Hollywood studios have given hideous birth to these past couple of years, I was in the mood for some good old fashioned imported hair raising terror. I had read about this film before going to see it, mostly because I had read a novel of the same title by Jeff Long which is about a terrifying cave exploration gone wrong, but this movie directed by Neil Marshall is a completely different story although similar in its originality. I dragged my husband to see this last night, promising him a different experience than all the horror movies as of late. We both are sick of paltry remakes of Japanese films, and big budget stinkers that involve lots of water and hair, and rely heavily on computer generated scares , This movie is a serious monster movie for a generation without monster movies. I really missed the good old days where the baddies were flesh and bone; the stories were fresh and didn't need too much elaboration, and I had the chance to see some unknowns get massacred. This movie delivered all that to us and more, its scary but not cheesy it has unknowns which is so rare nowadays to see a fresh face in a imaginative movie. it had an awesome story line, that was full of symoblism of course but not so blatant that you were rolling your eyes and saying ""okay, cave wombs, blood, rebirth i get it"" the movie also had great effects for a 6 million dollar budget, and I left feeling like I had a refreshing adrenaline horror filled enema, cleansing all the ""the saws, the grudges, the rings, the darkwaters, etc"" out of my system. I cant wait to buy this on DVD and see the other ending, any extras, and relive one of the best movies I have seen in years."

1,"Update: Note that this is an episode 7 version. Revell released a new version (Last Jedi) in 2018. The new model comes only in black & orange paint version and has a pilot & booster (see the pics). The size of the BB-8 unit & sound effects are also slightly different.
---------------------
I've got 6 Star Wars Build & Play models for my 4 Y.O. boy so far. I think this one is one of the first models in the Build & Play series. While all the others I've got have both ""light"" and sound effects, this one (and the other X-Wing with black & orange camo) has sound effects only. The sound effect is also not as cool/laud as some others (TIE fighter sounds the best IMO). Nevertheless, you can't skip this one if your kid wants a Star Wars Build & Play model I guess. One good side of this is that this one has a little higher chance to survive in your kid's hands, compared to the Level 2 X-Wing from Revell. The Level-2 X-Wing lasted a week or so (My son is extremely cautious when handling his toys) before its super thin laser cannons shafts were bent and some parts fall off. I don't see any advantage of buying Level-2 X-Wing over this one. This Level-1 model looks as good as the level-2 X-Wing.

Compared to other Build & Play models, this and the other X-Wings are exactly the same except for the color. The difficulty is on the low side. If you want to introduce this series to your child before the recommended age (8+), this can be a good starting point. You may also want to try TIE Fighter or Millennium Falcon. I wouldn't start with AT-AT though."

It's once again an entertaining story about a small town in the middle of nowhere, and a pair of very smart people, both very wealthy, very smart. The story revolves around a family of three, and the main character, a very smart man named Nicholas.

Nicholas is a smart man, and he has a very big heart. He is so smart, but he is also very self-centered. He is constantly thinking about his own life, and he is not very happy with his life, either. He does not want to be a ""bad"" person, but he is constantly thinking about his own life, and he is constantly thinking about his own life.

What I love about JR Ward is the fact that she introduces these main characters in earlier books so when the book finally comes up for them, they are already pretty developed and then you pop right into the story.  the way she twists it around and brings in stories on existing Brothers is also great.  Some series books will have the main characters and then you never see them again.  Not so with this series.  I keep thinking where is she going to go with this now, and she keeps surprising us.  Great read but you need to have read the priors to understand what is going on."
1,"I am probably not the most qualified person on Amazon to write a review on headphones/ear buds, but with that said, I LOVE THESE! Since my children are kleptomaniacs regarding anything electronic that Mom has, I only buy the super cheap headphones - the ones available at the gas station, costing $1-2. This cheapness keeps me from losing it when my earphones ""disappear"" several times a week. I was getting a few other things on Amazon and decided to try these. and guess what? THEY ARE AWESOME! I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these. (Most of the earphones I've had made Johnny Cash sound like Axl Rose. ) I am truly surprised at how clear these make music sound and how well I can actually understand podcasts and comedy now. It's like going from an 8-track to a CD - yep, there is that much of a difference. I am now a Gummy convert and will only use these. I have purchased an extra pair and I keep them well hidden. Bottom Line: These are fantastic ear buds, especially for the price. The incredible sound these provide make walking the dogs a true joy - allowing me to disappear into a cloud of loud, clear music, piped comfortably into the hearing holes on each side of my head. and keeps out the interruptions caused by a bunch of extraneous noise. You absolutely cannot go wrong with these - and their low price just elevates them to perfection."

Inuyasha basically said it himself that all his feelings for Kikyo are revolving around guilt and obligation because Kikyo died for him.  He feels it's necessary to give his life for her at the very least.  Please, the girl pulled a knife on him while they were embracing and even said he was like Naraku in his feelings toward her.

1,"A mysterious letter, a family secret and a sense of wanderlust leads Keelin to leave her life in Boston to travel to a small coastal town in Ireland. It's there where she finds the truth behind her gift and a sense of belonging she's never known before.

This book is rather sweet. But also infuriating at times. The author goes to lengths to show just how highly educated and wonderful Keelin is but she manages to do some fairly stupid things whilst in Ireland.

I liked the mixture of modern day life with the ancient magic which surrounds Keelin and her family. Keelin's romance with the man next door was rather hot with their chemistry being intense but they were a couple I wanted to know more about outside of their sexual compatibility.

Wild Irish Heart is an enjoyable romance story with a gorgeous setting. The characters were a little flat but considering this story was less than two hundred pages, I think there was probably just wasn't enough time to get to know them as much as I would have liked. I probably would continue this series because I found myself liking some of the secondary characters (who's book is next in the series) slightly more than I liked Keelin and her beau."

My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.

1,"Store bought cakes can be expensive.  We found a recipe to make bird seed cakes and adjusted it a bit so the cakes were not so hard.  We call them Bird-Day Cakes!

Use 1 pack of Knox Gelatin and 2 cups of water and 2 rounded cups of Bird Seed. Prepare Gelatin per directions.  You can use 2 packs if you want the seed cake more firm.  They might even last longer, but I can't imagine the birds like it.  This makes 2 mini bundt ""Bird-Day Cakes"".

Mix together and pour/pack into mini bundt cake molds that have been sprayed with your favorite non-stick spray. (Gotta have the hole in the center for this feeder.) Place in refrigerator until set.

We use Shell-less seeds for this.  They are expensive and you can certainly use regular bird seed or whatever your favorite bird loves.  We only use 1 cake at a time and haven't stacked them yet. The birds finish this off in 2-3 days.

Although this feeder has a small roof, continuous rain will melt away the cakes in a few days so better to make your own ""Bird-Day Cakes"" as a rainy day project and save some money."

1,"I haven't read the well regarded comic book (er, sorry, graphic novel), but this movie is terribly dull. The idea of taking well known characters from the Victorian Era's popular literature (Allan Quartermain, Captain Nemo, Tom Sawyer, Dr. Jekyll, Dorian Gray, The Invisible Man from the novel by H.G. Wells, Mina Harker from Dracula) and rethink them as superheroes sounds odd but interesting. And if such endeavor would make some young people read the original books, one can certainly sympathize with that. But this film is dull. The action scenes are uninspired. And one wonders if the filmmakers even read the original material: here Dorian Gray has more lives than Terminator, Verne's Captain Nemo looks more like Sandokan, Jekyll is inspired more by the incredible Hulk than by the character of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel, Tom Saywer is a hothead cowboy rather than Mark Twain's country boy, etc. There are fine actors here (Sean Connery, for one) but they look embarrassed here, as well as they should be. Even the retro Victorian look seems uninspired. Overall, a huge disappointment."

0,"If you have your hands on a basic computer, you know how to make a computer.  The other two have the same basic components.  The basic instruction booklet includes a lot of pictures, and a couple of basic instructions.  The instructions are pretty simple to follow.  You can use a 2-in-1 computer, or a 3-in-1 computer, or a 4-in-1 computer, or a 5-in-1 computer, or a 6-in-1 computer, or a 7-in-1 computer, or a 8-in-1 computer, and you can do that at home.  But you can also use a 3-in-1 computer and a 5-in-1 computer, and you can do that at home.  So it's not the best choice for the kids, but it's definitely a good option.  You can use the software to make a game of this sort, and the kids can play with their own computer.

They effortlessly grip like crazy yet don't mark, yet at the same time seem to be made of some kind of god like material that doesn't dent.

I would highly recommend this toy.I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  I did have to write a review on it since it has already been played with quite a bit and it seems pretty good.  I like that it is not a toy for toddlers or young children.  It seems like it will last for years, but I do have a few years left in it.  It is a good size for my 2.5 year old and I like that it does not have to be pushed too hard to get it to move.  I am sure it will last for years.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing with small children.We have this from the beginning of my son's life, and he loves it.  He plays with it constantly.  He was very happy with it.  The only complaint I have is that it was more expensive than the ones I ordered.

Our Yorkie is usually a very picky eater and she didn't hesitate to wolf down this new Chicken and Veggie Science Diet dog food with great enthusiasm. We do mix this SD dog food with their $50 a bag Blue Wilderness dry food, so it lasts longer and provides them with all the nutrition they need to stay active and healthy.

Writing style better than most with the occasional odd tense or participle. I would guess English is not original USA variety. So technically she could be correct while sounding off ... Example: he swimmed across the river and leant into the wind (shorter paraphrase) I would write as he swam across the river and leaned into the wind. For some reason that kept bugging me. Fabulous characters that grow and change, surprises everywhere, great fun. Be aware they start free and cost more at the end. Which is fair and smart."

1,"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation."

Furthermore, he translates the form of those trends into the logical consequences they would embody if left unchecked.  Read this book;you will find yourself pausing ever so often to ponder the current state of our culture, as it mirrors these words written over 50 years ago.  His writing and style are clear and profound.  I often would find myself trying to strectch my reading times because the ideas expressed were so compelling."

The large container is very spacious, I typically buy 13-18 pound bags of food and they fit very nicely (I leave the food in the bag).  The casters are fantastic - being able to wheel this around makes it so easy to clean and keeps the container off the ground.  There are two things keeping me from giving it 5 stars, (1) the scoop is way too big and awkward and (2) the small container is always in the way when stored on top of the big container.  I have bought two of these; I use one big one for ""long term"" storage and keep the two small containers on top.  The other big one I use to hold the food my dog eats on a daily basis.

It was sturdy but still easy to adjust for my non-tech-savvy relatives. The only downside (and this is not related to the product) is that I bought it as an warehouse deal which said ""minor cosmetic damage possible"" but instead it was missing a whole piece. There are supposed to be little foam stickers for the corners that help keep it gripped, but it works fine without them so I just went with it. I'm considering also purchasing the one that mounts on the wall for use in my kitchen."

1,"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this for them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true. I think a plain, non-verbal, no batteries required set is so much better to encourage open-ended play."

1,"We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker."

She has a very narrow fit and this specific style allows for great adjustment for her feet. We will stick with this style, just buying a new pair/size each summer! They also hold up great! I'm hoping her younger sister will be able to use the smaller pairs (depending on her size/season), as they are all still in great condition despite wearing and washing them all one summer each (growth is our only reason to replace, as she hasn't worn out a pair yet).

1,"I have used this for a few weeks and am very pleased with it.  First, it makes a good cup of coffee, even without factoring in the convenience.  I'm still trying different varieties.  The French Roast is so far my favorite.  By dialing in either 6, 7.5, or 9 oz, it is very easy to adjust the strength to your tastes.  I find even the 9 oz to be strong enough.

The build is very sturdy, better than most of the other pod coffee makers.  Charcoal filter in the water is a good idea for those living in the city.

Only disadvantages I see are that the machine is relatively expensive, it costs more per cup, of course, than a regular coffee maker, and your choices of coffees are more limited.  But if you only want one cup in the morning on the way out the door, it's certainly quick, with no mess, and leaves no wasted, leftover coffee.  I find it of good value."
1,"I placed 2 orders for these LED bulbs, as I decided to replace all bulbs with LED bulbs.  One bulb burned out within 2 months.  Today the second bulb burned out...6 months after I bought them.  Amazon did issue me a credit for the bulbs.  The price is right, the bulbs are bright, and our electric bill went down about $15 a month......but I'm a little concerned about the life expentency of the bulbs."
1,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.
0,"A book about the idols of the people.  The characters are complex and beautiful.  The writing is so well written and the story is so clear that you can't help but feel that you are part of the story.  The story is told in a very simple and very simple way.  It is a very simple book and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.  This book is a must read for any fan of all things New Age and spirituality.  Highly recommend this book.I enjoyed this book.  It was a little confusing at times, but it was a good book for a book club.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the teachings of the Buddha.I enjoyed this book and I can't wait to see what happens next.  I love the characters and the story line.

1,"I wish I got this charger a long time ago. With four banks I can charge my 36 volt trolling system and my cranking battery without using a second charger to do so. This charger has three phases of charging. The first phase charges to 75 percent at 10 amps then to 100 percent at 2 amps then it has a maintenance mode that it monitors itself. This charger is smaller than described. It measures 12"" long x 8"" wide x 10"" high."
1,"Possibly the worst book I have read this year. Really easy to put down, took me weeks to read it and I would usually finish a good book this length in 3-4 days tops (I have a lot of waiting time to fill so I read while I am waiting to pick people up).

SPOILER (perhaps) - I do not enjoy romance books where the hero and heroine end up having sex within the first few pages, especially when it makes no sense at all. I didn't feel any chemistry between them, I didn't think the way it was written in the historical sense was particularly logical either.

I really wanted to read the Arcane society novels and I have book two, so I might try that one, but it had better be written WAY better than this one.

Was this perhaps one of her first books? I don't know, but I really like JAK usually, just not this one at all!"

The action is somewhat like a fish in it's last moments of life, when it is just occasionally flapping around on the surface on it's side. It is weedless, so I can give it credit for that. Honestly I've had better luck with the frog lures from the same brand. The coloring and look of this sunfish are very accurate, but just know that it ""swims"" on it's side, with the fish hooks facing the sky and the other side of the fish facing the bottom of the lake (weighted), and will never ""swim"" in the normal vertical orientation."

Since I do a reading program w/ my service dog at my local elementary school, I like to read some of the books my 4th and 5th graders do.  I can't believe none of my three 30 something children ever read this book when they were in school but I guess it was pretty controversial when it first came out. I found it very thought provoking w/ strong messages that young people need to hear today and have already recommended it to some of the children in my reading program as many of them have read Number the Stars to me and my dog - glad I bought it!"

1,"Original remote became unreadable after 3 years, all i had to do is put batteries and it worked great."
1,"Cons:
Biggest con: cables sometimes not long enough. Also, it REQUIRES A DRIVER. Will not work properly without it.
I got this unit so I can run a dekstop and laptop together. A few things to note... the vga cables are short an dthe attached usb cable is short but appears to work on most pc's as long as the ports needed are open. The vga cable being short meant that I had to purchase a vga extension cable.
As mentioned switching isn't instantaneous etc.
5 second delay to get the mouse recognized.
Also I may be wrong but the usb appeared to be needed to be plugged in for the switch to work or detect.
At the beginning I also encountered trouble with installing the driver.
The windows 7 machine works flawlessly. The xp machine appears to not detect that the belkin is connected. However it still outputs a signal and works. I just can't use software switching. Only the hardware using the button.
Also the monitor plugs are tough to connect but work fine.

Biggest pro:
The big simple switch. I wish it was longer to reach me but the switch is very useful. Just tapping it with my foot does the job. I haven't tried out the audio so I can't comment on how well it works. I also haven't tried connecting usb 2 devices to it.
I give it 3 stars because of the software trouble and trouble getting it to install correctly. But it really is a remarkable device and it does what it sets out to do."

1,"Because this movie was made by Baz Luhrmann (Moulin Rouge, Australia, Romeo+Juliet), I had high expectations. And a lot of those expectations were met: beautiful cinematography, a good amount of music, a nice tragic love story, over-the-top but well-done drama. Unfortunately though, it got pretty slow towards the end, and the music wasn't nearly as integrated as it could (and I think should) have been.  I'm not sure an entire song was ever played through, and it wasn't nearly as important to the plot of the movie as it was, for example, in Moulin Rouge. I was disappointed. But as for the rest of the movie, the acting was great and the story was great, and there's not much more you need for a high rating from me."

1,"King has a natural (maybe supernatural) talent of writing horror novels. Everyone knows that. What a lot of folks don't know is he is one of our generations greatest writers period taking genre out of the equation. I've never read a novel that jumps back and forth to two timelines that I've enjoyed...until now. King does it effortlessly and fluidly. Also the story itself is so absorbing I had a hard time putting this book down each night. Childhood and childhood fears are two things King does great with and this story is no exception. The young characters come to life instantly. Its easy to picture each one. With all that said, this is perhaps the scariest novel I've ever read. One novel comes to mind that trumps this one in the scare department and its not King. It was immensely spooky because it dealt with not only childhood fears, which we can all relate to, but an evil of magnitudal proportions. Yes, this book is long but every paragraph is needed to build this story. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy if you've never read this."

1,"I have the large nylabone these treats fit into, and my dogs love this treat. It's an excellent distraction toy to keep them busy and quiet.  My larger one gets it first and chews it down and then my smaller one finishes it up (we have plenty of toys, but they always want the toy the other one has right then, just like kids).  This at least keeps them occupied long enough for us to get through a tv episode without crazy dog romper room play all over the couch (and anyone who has the misfortune of sitting on the couch at the time).  Usually their puppy exuberance is cute, but sometimes I like the quiet.

These treats are worth the money and way less messy than trying to fill the nylabone with peanut butter.  Some of them don't snap into place as well as others, but I can usually press those in well enough.  I'll def buy these again."

Gina Kelly thinks that realizing that her husband might have tricked her out of getting any money in their pending divorce is the worst thing that could ever happen to her; least that is was she thinks until he is murdered and she becomes the prime suspect.  Gina is not an investigator, but she has already been following her cheating spouse and that woman with great success for all the good it did.  Now she turns her attention to figuring out who could have killed the jerk and tried to frame her.  After all she is the most obvious suspect and she knows she didn't do it."

Lacey had a terrible time with the guys and decided to quit her job. She was just starting a new job and her friend, Danielle, is the head of the sports marketing company that she's been working on. She's a bit of a Dom and doesn't want to give up on a woman she's attracted to. She's been lusting after him since she was a child and just didn't want to give up on him.

She meets Ben, a Dom who's been in love with her since they were teens. He's not exactly a Dom but he's a Dom. He wants her to have sex with him but he's not willing to give up on her. When she's in a bad mood she goes home to her parents to see how it will go.

Ben and Lacey are in the same bed together but he's not sure how to act on that. He wants her to have sex with him but she doesn't want to. She's just afraid of the guy.

1,"Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels."
1,"This game is very creative, i will give it that. The components are lacking. The little black clips slide around and make it hard for gameplay, as most of us don't remember how many points we have on the cards. One member of our group used some pieces of note card to pad under the clips, it helped if you don't feel like replacing the parts.
It's a good game to play with 6 people, although it does take seemingly forever to get to your turn again (i was always the last player to go, so it didn't help).
I wish i wasn't a visual learner sometimes, because when people read off their cards it's a bit hard to follow, but i just asked for the card to be passed around the group if there was nothing ""secret"" on it.
With six people playing it can take 3 hours of playtime, depending on how the game goes. We got this for our D&D group for when some players cannot show up but we still want to play something. However, with how much of a hit it was in the group, we may have to start another night for playing just this game!.
I would give it 5 stars, but the piece problems are a bit annoying."

1,"Add this book to the growing pile of books to give a child waiting desperately for the next (and final) installment in the Harry Potter series. This may make the wait a little less unbearable, though nothing will be much solace once J.K. Rowling pens the last page in Book 7. There's only so much one can do about that, after all.

The Thief of Always is also a great choice for anyone smitten by Lemony Snicket, as it features a similarly dark story line with menacing adult characters. There's none of the wonderful banter between author and reader found in A Series of Unfortunate Events, nor really any of the wickedly twisted humor, but there should be just enough terror and danger to keep most fans of this genre riveted.

Harvey Swick is 10 years old and very bored with the long, cold days of February. One day a mysterious man appears, suddenly, in Harvey's room. The man asks Harvey if he'd like to go someplace where life is always fun. Being a self-centered yet somewhat strangely trusting 10 year old, Harvey agrees, and he's led away by the man.

The house where the mysterious man takes Harvey is in a land that's always sunny during the day. Halloween and Christmas, those two revered favorite holidays of children, come every evening. Harvey and another boy, Wendell, have all their wishes granted in this wondrous house, but one day Harvey starts to see that all isn't as it should be, and evil lurks beneath the facade of perfection...

A quick and satisfying read, this is as entertaining for adult fans of the genre as children."

This is a great product for dogs that need something to chew on. I love that it is made in the USA. I am very happy with this purchase. I have a 15 lb. lab mix, and I like this collar to allow him to chase his prey, and also to let him know when he is ready to return. It also seems to help him get a good grip on the leash. I would recommend this collar for dogs who need to be able to stay in a leash. I have a large dog, and he is always chasing after his prey. He is very strong, and this collar is a great option for him. He is also very playful with it. It is very easy to adjust, and he gets to it quickly."
1,"Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far."

1,"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.  I think if you write one more ""Hutch behind a desk"" story I may have to give up on you."

1,"Used this to splice join together two audio cables and started to wonder why my music sounded so strange.  A little bit of testing showed that this coupler was outputting a mono signal instead of a stereo signal.  Both speakers were getting sound but it was from the same channel, the other channel was being left behind.  I had to go out to an electronics store to get one that worked correctly."
1,"My kids love these soft, bright cars.  Each one is a different vehicle in a different color--they are bright appealing and a great little toy.  Pull one back and let it go--and it zooms across the floor easily! Thing is, my kids are older than 2 and so a little past the age for this particular toy.  So it was perfect when my 1 year old nephew came to visit and we could test drive them with him!

Huge success.  The lightweight, plush design makes them easy for him to grab and hold onto.  He hasn't quite got the zooming thing down yet, but I'm sure he'll get the idea soon enough with my children's avid assistance.  My nephew is drooling quite a lot now (teething) so the cars inevitably got coated in drool and later on in banana.  That's when the particular cleverness of these really became apparent.  The plush tops can be unlatched from the wheel base (just undo the velcro) and washed off without the worry of getting the car mechanism wet.  And while these are certainly an appropriate toy for a one year old, I wouldn't likely leave him with the cars without supervision (just in case a wheel could be pried off), but we can take the car base off and let him play with the plush tops all on their own!

A great toy, and a great gift.  For parents and gift-giving friends who want a toy that's fun but doesn't require batteries and won't send everyone crazy with repeating sounds and lights--this might be just what you're looking for!

Happy playing! ^_^ Shanshad"

1,"Boston Medical Examiner Maura Isles is called to a gruesome scene early on Christmas morning, where a young woman has been brutally killed and dismembered, with satanic symbols all around her body and the Latin word ""Peccavi"" (I have sinned) scrawled backwards across her bedroom wall. Detective Jane Rizzoli, back on the job after maternity leave, suspects a serial killer is on the loose when Maura's nemesis, psychiatrist Joyce O'Donnell, is murdered in the same manner. Dr. O'Donnell was part of a group of scholars from around the world calling themselves the Mephisto Club that track demons. When members of this group are murdered and Maura's life is threatened, the action moves to Europe in search of a young woman whom the Mephisto Club is certain will draw the demon to them.

This captivating thriller touches on a fascinating subject: demonology, its origins and presence in the world today. Gerritsen's outstanding characterization is once more on display along with a thrilling, fast-paced plot. Jane Rizzoli remains a strong character, a jaded woman whose marriage and baby have become a calming force. Maura is a lonely woman intrigued by a priest, and this relationship is a painful one for Maura as well as the reader, who longs for Maura's happiness. Gerritsen offers a galvanizing look at Rizzoli's parents, the two people who shaped her, which helps the reader understand her cynicism and insecurities. An electrifying read."

When connected to Bluetooth, there is an annoying blue light that flashes on the right side of the headphones.  It is bright enough to annoy my wife because it flashes on her.  So I had to tape a piece of black electrical tape over the light.

1,"As an agnostic female who has achieved success at high tech companies in various positions and who has a well rounded life including volunteerism, I thought this book might help me define what I want to do for the second half of my life.

Instead I found it filled with example of example of people whose lives turned to serving God/faith based causes (granted I skimmed after a while but didn't see any examples of Indians or successful people of other relgions, only Christians).

There were about 5 women out of 61 people total profiled.

On the contrary Po Bronson's book focused on people from all walks of life, not those who have been VP or higher or had ""interesting"" lives.

I found this book completely useless in that it seemed to have sneakily omitted it's true agenda of pushing faith by having NO MENTION ANYWHERE ON THE BOOK JACKET OF RELIGION."

1,"Savannah Martin has not had an easy time of it. At fourteen, her mother abandoned her and, despite being fostered as part of a caring family, the scars still run deep. Returning home after breaking away from an abusive relationship, the heartache is not over. The patriarch of the family has been murdered and the family is reeling from the loss and the continuing threat to their business and their lives. Jared Corbit is her sister Lexis boyfriend and she wished she felt brotherly thoughts towards to him. What was she going to do?

Told from Savannahs point of view, her emotional turmoil feels so real. There seems to be one punch after another to herself and those around her and the anguish and she feels cannot be hidden. The author knows just the right thing to say to convey the mood, the feelings of uncertainty, pain and love. And there is a lot of love in this story despite tackling the serious issues. Abuse and its ripple effect, abandonment and its life-long consequences are at the center of Savannahs struggle as she tries to deal with her family and the situation she finds herself in now. Jared is more than she feels she deserves and the roller coaster of events that happen don't ease that feeling. Surprising twists and still a lot of uncertainty has me eagerly looking for the second part of this two-book storyline."

This book, in my opinion, is a mirror on life itself (as well as life that has ended). I agree with the reviewer that wished the author had gone into some detail on finding and buying vintage photos. The sad thing is that most of the digital photos taken today will end up lost in la la land in the years to come, never to be seen again."

1,"So there is a reason this food is a #1 best seller in dry dog food. It's not just because of the price for the size bag but it's the taste and scent the dogs go crazy for. Diamond pet foods had one bad recall a few gets back and everyone wants to judge them based on that. Doesn't just about everything everywhere get a recall at some point in its life span? My chocolate lab Bruce wasn't eating Wild Calling! And Natures Variety Instinct gave him the worst soft stool ever. I ordered this on Prime Now and it came to my doorstep in just under an hour.

1,"Nine Lorien teenagers were sent to earth to await their legacies, special powers that each possess, in order to return to their planet to save it. Number Four, Daniel Jones, is moving from Florida to Paradise, Ohio, with his new name, John Smith, and his Cepan, or guardian, Henri.

In Paradise, John tries to start a life as he acquaints himself with Sarah Hart, a friendly, smart ex-cheerleader. Of course, with an ex-cheerleader there's an ex-boyfriend, Mark James, who isn't so happy about the chemistry between John and Sarah. As John begins to fall for Sara, she becomes another person who would be in danger from the Mogadorians, another alien race that are hunting the Lorien teens.

Each Lorien teen is at a different place on Earth. Three have already been caught and killed, which is made clear through the scars on each of the remaining teens' ankles. As another one dies, another scar will appear in order to determine who will be hunted next. Because of a charm, the nine teens must be killed in their chronological order. As number four, John knows he's next.

Despite its controversial co-author, one can't argue that I AM NUMBER FOUR reads just like a script, so it's no surprise that it has been turned into a movie. The novel itself has scenes that are so action-packed, with a little romance thrown in, that it will captivate readers of all ages.

With the sequel, THE POWER OF SIX, releasing in August 2011, only read I AM NUMBER FOUR if you are willing to become addicted to another series.

The only person who can save them is Eve who doesnt even know that she holds the secret to saving the human race.

Apocalypse Evolution was a good story.  Its definitely science fiction with a nice apocalyptic touch.  There were a few unbelievable parts, but in science fiction, you can have totally out there things that could/would happen in certain circumstances.

Bryces writing was tight and to the point.  There wasn't too much wasted time in this short story.  The comes at a slight fault, though, we really don't know much about Eve and her backstory other than that she is basically on borrowed time and being hunted. I think a little more into the who and why for her character would really catapult this short story into the great range."

1,"My only recollection of the TV version of ""The Green Hornet"" is when they did a guest appearance on ""Batman"".  Robin(Burt Ward) fought Kato(Bruce Lee) to a draw(?!).  Kipnapped heiress Pinky Pinkston left an SOS for the Dynamic Duo in her alphabet soup.  The guest villain was the incomparable Roger C. Carmel as Colonel Gumm.  What does all this have to do with the price of tea in China?  Absolutely nothing but I figured I'd write some totally superfluous and extraneous remarks for the Hornet haters who'll get all over me for loving this movie.  I never read the comic books or saw the Tv series so I accept this movie for what it is and it's a total blast.  Star/writer/producer Seth Rogen took a character that is sacrosanct to many and fashioned it to fit his devil-may-care persona purists be damned.  The nocturnal adventures of the Hornet and Kato come off more as a fraternity pledge prank than as some altruistic endeavor and I thought that was a hoot.  What would Kevin Smith think?  Rogen is aces in my book but the real find is Jay Chou as Kato. Chou's Kato has a real alliance with the Hornet instead of just riding shotgun and displaying his karate moves.  Christoph Waltz extends his street cred that he established in ""Inglourious Basterds"" as the head of the Russian mob and he's as equally chilling and funny as he was in that movie.  James Franco has a terrific cameo as Waltz's ""competition"".  And how can you forget the cool cars and stunt work.  I love that Rogen took the material not too seriously but just serious enough."

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.  Other than that, it's a great product!"

1,"""Knowing"" (2009) is directed by Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow, I,Robot). This film is about a time capsule that is opened fifty years later with pictures drawn by children, however, one of the pictures drawn by a child was only filled with numbers. This sheet of numbers falls into the hands of a scientist who discovers that they predict various disasters. This is the second time over the past two years that I have seen this film, but this was the first time that I had seen it on blu-ray, and this really is the way to see this film. It's a beautifully directed apocalyptic sci-fi film that looks and sounds amazing (DTS HD Master Audio;5.1 Dolby Digital). There was one scene of a forest fire that was so vivid with the crackling sounds of fire that I felt I was right in the middle of a forest fire. When I first saw this film on dvd I thought that it was okay, but it was only after seeing it on the blu-ray format that I really appreciated its majestic beauty. If one has enjoyed the ""X-files"" TV series then one may enjoy this film too."

Where that one man decides the fate of all who live in those areas when water no longer available. Exiled is a great story with many strong, likable (and hated) characters in a realistic, future world. What starts out as a normal day for Brooke and her two children soon turns into a race to leave their home when she realizes that something is not right. The story jumps across the United States, following this corrupt man and his opponents as he pushes through a vile piece of legislation dealing with the waterless area. Within this story are parts of really interesting storylines that will hopefully be explored and expanded. My hope that this one man gets his due will keep me reading until the end!"

1,"First, I find the main character, Lucas Davenport, one of the most compelling characters of this genre.  He is the type of guy I would like to be, or at least know, if I were transported to a fictional universe.  He is not quite in the league, interest-wise, as a Harry Bosch, but likable and edgy just the same.  I'm somewhat surprised that he hasn't made his way on the big or little screen.  This being said, however, this book was a disappointed as it degenerates into a story that might play if Lifetime, Spike and the SciFi channel merge.  Sandford has written much better in the past and I'm hoping his story lines have not run dry.  It's a decent beach or summer read but take it for what it is.  A reasonable entertaining work that will kill a few hours but be forgotten  in just about the same amount of time."

Violet is recuperating from a serious accident that killed her fianc and left her badly scarred.  Her favorite pastime is ogling her sexy and very hot neighbor, as he repairs his roof.  When he falls from the roof, Violet rushes over, only to find him sprawled on a trampoline.  Making sure he's fine, he admits that he knew that she had been watching him, and wanted to meet her, figuring this was the only way it was going to happen.  For the first time Violet wants to let loose, to be reckless, something she's never had the courage to do, as the future CEO of Walker Construction.  She wants Noah, that is no secret, but she can't let him see her scars, so they embark in a just sex relationship.  How can she do this without baring herself.
When Noah sees his sexy neighbor watching him, he pretends to fall off the roof, hoping that she'll come over, so he can finally meet her.  Noah knows that Violet is hiding something since she only wants them to use their first names, and why is she always wearing scarfs when it's not even cold out.  As they get to know each other, they both start having feelings for each other.  However, how can they go forth when she doesn't trust him enough to reveal herself and her secrets.

1,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who found this movie ridiculously boring and ill-paced.  I'm also glad that Kip Pardue has disappeared from film, since his presence was an ink stain on anything he graced.  He is just so dull.  This flick doesn't do him any favors.  Sure, the racing sequences are exciting, but they are all so overdone and glossy that they lose their edge and become preposterous eye-soars.  The remainder of the cast is also a mess.  Estella Warren makes a pretty bland romantic interest.  She's cute enough, but she's also ridiculously dull.  Sylvester Stallone has never been `talented' in this area, and he doesn't bring any of the glimmers of promise he mustered out of that overrated 1976 boxing flick.  Instead, he grumbles through this film as if he was merely tolerating it.  The only shimmer of light comes from a predictably catty Gina Gershon who is always a delight, regardless of the fact that she can't seem to play more than one shade of character.  In the end, this tiresome bore is far from worth the price of admission.  This is easily one of the worst films 2001 had to offer, and that's saying a lot considering that the year also birthed such travesties as `Glitter', `Jurassic Park III', `Swordfish' and `The One'."

1,I chose this on a recommendation from a reliable friend. In the beginning I had hope this book would become more likable.  I trudged through to the end.  I could not identify with any of the characters.  I was not sympathetic to any of the main characters.  Don't waste your time.
1,"It's ironic as I bought this ""cheap"" harness because my puppy managed to chew his way through four very expensive harnesses in two weeks. In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy)."

0,"I wasn't sure what I was going to say, but I did. The first couple of pages are full of action, intrigue, and then the beginning of a great romance. The story picks up right where the first book left off. I love how the author gives us the first couple of pages and then the last page, which is where the story ends. It really shows how much I love the author's writing style and how she keeps the story moving along."
0,"Without giving away any of the specifics, the book is a quick read that will keep you wanting to read more. The author, Eric Haus, is a master at writing a story that keeps you turning pages in a matter of minutes. This book is a great addition to the series. I highly recommend this book. I had to wait on book 2 to finish the story because I didn't want to put the book down. I have a hard time putting down this series. I enjoyed all the characters. I loved the characters. I just couldn't get into it."
1,"Seems to work well for me as long as I use a powered-hub with it.  I have placed a powered-hub on each end to ensure stability with the power and signals.  So far I haven't seen any issues.  Without the hub on the far end I do not get a reliable signal for a simple USB keyboard.  I have seen this with other cables once you get past 30', so I expected this and I accepted this.  One could argue that this should be noted and perhaps even built-in to these cables.

I have not tested data performance at this distance because I typically don't place a drive on a cable run of this length - I just use my ThinkPad USB Keyboard and phone devices."

1,"We got a new swing set and needed a few swings for it. I had a baby bucket seat but my 2yo wanted her own big girl seat. I picked up another seat a few days before this one so will be comparing the two. The other one was $7 more so will take that into consideration.
This seat says that it will hold up to 250lbs and so does the other one. One thing that this one says on the bag is that it is meant for 3-10 yo. Also it is just a plain green swing and the other one has information on the backside. The other one has more plastic underneath so it looks heavier and stronger. The chains are both the same length and commercial grade and covered with a yellow plastic coating for comfort and safely.
Overall I am very satisfied with this swing. It is perfect for our play set and the girls love it. I think that the other swing is slightly better than this one but just by a hair.
I got this Heavy Duty swing seat at a discount for my testing, evaluation & honest, unbiased review. The fact that I got them at a discount has not influenced or impacted my judgment of this product. I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product."

1,".......during this peculiar political season - make it this one.

The whole thing - every page - from beginning to end is sardonic and ingeniusly written.  The humor is not restricted to just one format.  There are hilarious forms to fill out, games to play and paragraphs that made me flat-out laugh and giggle.

The phrasing and timing of each ""piece"" is perfect and if you can imagine some of these spoofs on the show it's even more hysterical.  But you never need to have seen the show to enjoy this book and I mean just enjoy it - page after hilarious page."

I'm a little disappointed in the sound of the horn- it sounds like a really loud kid's toy horn. So, even though it's definitely loud enough for cars to hear, I wish it had a little deeper, more ""serious"" sound to it.

I also find it a little difficult to use it with my air pump- the floor pump's tube isn't long enough to reach it while it's mounted on the handlebar so I have to unmount it and unwind some of the horn's tubing to get it low enough."

1,"UPDATE 8/8/2012: I haven't had the case/cover for 3 months, yet...and it's already showing signs of falling apart. I use the case/cover at home and for one class I'm taking, and after a short 3 months it's surface material is cracking and starting to peel off where the cover folds (multiple locations). I do like the case, but it's going to look very ratty in a few more months. At this rate I'll need a case every 3-4 months and that quickly ads up over a year's time frame (which would be an acceptable amount of time for a single case/cover to survive).

Old Review: Great case for the iPad. This thing goes in and out of my back pack, loose leaf binder, and around campus. It's a simple design-in black-and most folks don't know it's an iPad until I open the cover. I just need to learn and not show off, so this fits the need perfectly. I would have given 5 stars, but I find the cover sometimes moves enough that the unlock screen will come on. In a side-by-side comparison, the Apple screen cover has about twice the hold of this one, but this one protects the whole device and helps my hands grip what would otherwise be the difficult to handle smooth aluminum back."

1,"I bought this Women's V Neck Short Sleeve Lace Mesh Inset Open Back Casual Plus Size Top in caramel, I thought on the screen it was a lovely neutral color and I still think so after receiving it. I will say right away that I am plus sized and these run small. I bought a 3X and unfortunately its like its painted on me instead of a little loose. Knowing that though, if you're thinner than me, or a different shape (I am an apple) I would buy at least a size up. I will say though I tested this just like any other clothing I get to test and review in exchange for my honest unbiased feedback. I don't hand wash. Anything. Ever. Thats what washing machines are for. Mine has a hand wash setting, so I decided to try putting the shirt in on that setting. I have used it for many hand wash only items before with no problem. Same thing this time. The shirt came through the wash and tumble dry on medium heat just fine. I would always recommend following the label instructions, but if you're lazy like me and want to try a machine, youd probably be ok. Even though I won't be wearing this shirt until I hopefully lose some weight, I do think its a lovely fabric, color and style. I found it very soft and quite comfy, albeit too tight for my liking. That being said, if you're into form fitting tops, you might want to wear this, I just prefer looser, more flowy tops.

It has amused both my daughter and her friends (12-month-olds), and our 3-year-old niece for 10 or 15 minutes at a time, which is pretty good for a toy. I find myself playing with it when I'm supposed to be cleaning up the play room. Sure, it would be awesome if it had a volume control, but I don't think the volume is anywhere near damaging my child's hearing and I don't find the music annoying so I don't mind it.

1,"4.5 Star Review
Kylie Wilson was in love with Marcus Stone until he abruptly left two years ago to pursue a career in snow skiing.  She stayed close to his twin brother Malcolm and over the last year, they spoke less and less about Marcus during their weekly phone calls.  One day Kylie received an invitation to the island of Eden and it was signed, The one who's always loved you.  Naturally, Kylie assumed it was Marcus.

I love the Invitation to Eden series.  The reader can always count on that ""feel good"" feeling at the end of the book.  Elena Aitken did not disappoint.  One thing you must remember about Eden is that the island always knows what you want and need, even if you have yet to realize it.  Kylie and Malcolm's story was very sweet and romantic.  I look forward to more from this series and this talented author.

It has a nice look to it feels strong. The swivel is a nice feature to have, and you can adjust it to make it tighter or looser.

It took a few extra days because of the holiday but I had the new necklace a week later.  Only bummer is that since it was a Christmas gift I had to wait weeks to get it to my niece since they wouldnt allow me to have the necklace shipped to an address other than the original shipping address.  My niece lives an hour and a half from me.  Overall I give this necklace 4 stars because its super cute but I don't expect it to last long due to the quality of the first necklace.

1,"Beneath The Twelve Mile Reef was the second or third Cinemascope movie. Cinemascope format was like IMAX format turned on its side - it was wide, rather than tall. Cinemascope movies were in color, and most movies were not in color in 1953. Scenes were typically breathtaking; actors were beautiful or handsome as appropriate. With all that, plot and acting were frequently deficient. BTTMR has more or less adequate acting, its scenes were originally beautiful, and its actors appealed to audiences of the day. That was enough to get it by.

The movie fell into the public domain a while back. Many grainy copies emerged. Also, televisions could not adequately frame the Cinemascope format, so copies were abbreviated laterally. As a result, all the elements that originally sold this movie were neutralized. The version I purchased on Amazon VOD was unforgivably poor, and of course the deficient plot remains. Indeed, the writing is less forgivable than the appearance.

At some point, it seemed to me that I had been watching this turkey for an awfully long time so I checked to see how much more I had to endure. The ROKU told me four minutes. Hmmm. Four minutes. Problem was the movie still had a half dozen plot lines unresolved. I continued the movie.

In four minutes, the bad guys showed up, there was a fight, then everybody kissed and made up, the meanest bad guy happily gave his girl to the youngest good guy, and the credits rolled. Four minutes. (Did I mention?)

That's... really... bad script writing! You almost have to admire it!"

1,"Excellent adapter for my recess light. Despite the instruction from the seller about removing the ballast and same from many users, I did not remove the ballast in my recess can (don't know if it even has it). And it worked fine just plug and play. I did check the voltage on the terminals of my recess can which has the gx23 connector and it was 120v to confirm that the LED would work ok. I guess the ballast removal is required for some old CFL light, but if you can confirm 120v is the voltage out of your gx23 before plugging this adapter in then no need to worry about it.
Update: given that so many said about bypassing the ballast, I just did an experiment. I have 3 recess lights in the kitchen having the gx23 plug. I reopened one and bypassed the ballast. It's kind of pain doing that. The black (hot) wires are hard connected to the ballast (one in one out), so bypassing means cutting them off and reconnect. Note that to see the ballast, you need to unscrew a side screw in the recess can and then lower the top plate which has the gx23 mounted on it. you will see the ballast which is a little silver box attached to it. I only did the bypass for one of three lights just to see if anything changes. Now turned on the lights and I could not notice any difference! No humming noise from the ones with the ballast (not bypassed) either."

1,my cats stay off my furniture and stay off for quite some time when i put the Ssscat on. I just wish it would last longer.
0,This fitness circle is smaller than a regular gym bag. I will admit that it's a bit bulky. If you want to get a solid workout then this is the bag for you. The only thing I would change is the size of the padding. This bag is still large enough for me and a 2 person with a 2 person body type. I will probably only use this if I need to do something more than just a cardio workout. The padding is very soft and very comfortable. The material is very durable and works very well. I highly recommend this bag. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I've used this product for about a year now and it's been working great.
1,its a compact bag. if you want carry more things. its better you bought bigger one. its tight fit bag. if you want to buy bag for only camera its a good one.
1,"I bought this chain because I was having some minor but persistent shifting problems with the other new chain that I had just installed. I noted that other reviewers had said that it improved their shifting, so I thought that it might help, and it seems to have done the trick. No mis-shifts or stuttering since I put this on after about 30 miles of test driving where I did up and down shifting frequently.
 A couple of notes. One is that the missing link was in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chains for 6/7/8 speed bikes. As others have noted it is 7.3 mm vs 7.1 , a tiny difference but trust me, you can't get a 7.1 missing link to work (I tried by accident)."

There are some scenes that I find amusing, but I felt that the movie was just too dull. The last scene was a bit too long and I didn't care for it. I was happy to see that the film ended after a few minutes. I thought that maybe it was the ending. I liked the ending, but I was disappointed in the ending. The ending was a bit too slow and it didn't work."

1,"Just got it and it is a delight to use in drawing and Notes Applications which is why I bought it. It feels like a pen or pencil when writing and you can see where the tip is. That is a great advantage for detail work and for writing.

 I don't know if it would work as well for browsing and selecting things since it makes a small blunt sound as you touch the screen. It is annoying when pointing at things, but not there when sliding for writing and sketching. I bought spare points in case they are not available in the future. So far so good and I am loving it. Another great design is, that you can unwind the bottom part from the top and  screw it back on with the tip fitting inside the top part, where it is safe from any danger."

Sometimes I would say "" Xiao Hei! Come eat!"" and I would throw her the treat (she likes to catch food in her mouth). Nope, She would catch the liver treat and then spit it out. I'm very sad. Also these treats are a little smelly."

The headphones are in good shape, they are well made and look good. They are a bit too small to be comfortable, but they are comfortable and I think they will last a long time. If you are looking for a sound bar with a good sound quality, these are definitely worth the money. Update: I received these headphones at a discount from Amazon."
1,"This stuff seems to work.  We foster cats and ringworm is a constant problem as many feral cats carry the fungus and it is easily transmitted from cat to cat.  It is a bit expensive, but I cannot complain as it seems to work.  We applied it to a all white cat that had developed the classic ""bald"" spots and under black light glowed brightly.  As I applied the diluted product to the animal I notice strands of the fungus breaking away from the main body of the infestation!  I have never seen this before.  It has always taken 3 weeks or more to get the infestation down and for hair to start to grow back!  It is a tenacious fungus and infects humans as well!  It's not perfect and it is not an overnight cure.  After about two weeks, I can say the cat (kitten) is fungus free and suffered no ill effects.  We foster up to 15 kittens so it's a chore to isolate those cats with infestation from the others as the spores are airborne.  So it takes a lot of vacuuming, cleaning changing bedding and treatment to get control again.  If you have ringworm on a cat, give this a try."

0,PROS:  tried this wanting to say it was a good flashlight but it didn't work. I bought two of the same. I also bought the T20 version of this flashlight that I have had in the past. The T20 version is very compact and gives you a great light. I have also tried the T20 version with the T40 and T40-6 and I have had them both work as well as the T40-6. I have not used the T20 version yet but I have tried the T20 version with the T40-6 and it has worked great. The T40-6 is not as bright as the T20 version but it is still bright enough to see if something is behind the counter. I had a few of these flashlights that I have tried but the T40-6 is very good for this kind of flashlight. I have had two of these flashlights that I have used for a few years and they are very good.

1,"Sometimes you read a book that you just devour. You inhale it. It consumes you. This is what The Perfect Life did to me.

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise."

1,"Only a portion of this film is devoted to the actual rendition of the Water Music, and only a bit of the portion at that. The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat. Interesting and worth a watch, but not a huge thrill."

1,"My daughter seems to not get the hang of it.  She almost looks too big for it (she's 2) or the product seems to not inflate all the way (but we've inflated it to the max, where it seems like it's about to burst).  She falls off easily and doesn't bounce well on it.  I thought it would be like the videos but instead of bouncing up and down my daughter seems to lose her balance on it quickly.  Maybe it's just because when I first gave this to my daughter she was still trying to balance out having a large head (don't toddlers look like cute bobble heads, lol) but her balancing skills are much better now.  I'll try to give it to her again and see if she can play with it more now.  Before she would bounce and go flying off the thing but I think she's gotten more skills at balancing the past 4 months and will be able to use this more in the spring.  I like it because it's adorable and seems like it will be a ton of fun once she gets used to the concept.  She really does have fun on it the times I let her play but I always have to put pillows around her and be on alert in case she falls.  As she gets older though she'll have a blast."
1,"I bought these in large, and to be honest I was a little worried because I've gained some weight and a large would have been my normal size. I'm 5'9 and weigh 170. However, the large was actually a little baggy in the legs! This was perfect for me, because I bought them to turn into shorts, but if I had wanted them to remain pants then I would have either needed a medium or to take the legs in. The waistband was perfect (my stomach is where my weight gain has happened), so they will make perfect shorts.
I bought these in teal, and in my experience different colors of pants have different fits, so definitely find reviews for the color you are wanting if you are worried about fit."

I had to find a toy that could hold a child's attention and keep them engaged. I ordered it at a discount and it arrived on time. This toy is a must have for any child who likes to play with toys. It's very soft and my daughter is almost 3. I love that it has a ""stiff"" feel to it and that it is really sturdy. My daughter is not only happy with it but she is also excited about the new games that come out of it. It's a good toy for a baby. I wish it had a little more weight to it but I would recommend it. This is a fun little game that I really like. I like that it is a little smaller than the other ones and the game board is larger.

1,"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case."

Most of the battles in Vietnam were fought in back roads, and backyards, and very few large scale battles. This showed the horrible price that US troops pay in the first real offensive battle.
A platoon was pinned down, and other platoon rush to there rescue, only to be slaughter WWI style, the final battle sence, a classic unrealistic WWII battle charge.
But remember this was the very START of the conflict, and we knew little about jungle and gurilla warfare.
There was only one thing that cheezed me. It was Moore's (Gibson)
remark on the M16. ""It's a good rifle.""
Sure the M16A1 was a great rifle, A2 even better, but the oringal M16 by Euegne Stoner (if my history is correct) was a HORRIBLE rifle, it was rumored to be self-cleaning which lead to
abuse and missuse. The perellent was dirty and it had to be clean ever fifteen minutes, whole platoons were found with there M16 broken down and cleaning kits out."

1,Just got this. It is not universal for ski poles. It does not fit on the slim carbon composite  ski poles. They don't tell you that. It also broke.
1,"Quality collars, very impressed with the craftsmanship. Only 4 stars because the posted measurements are incorrect. They should have fit both of my dogs; one 50lbs but stocky, the other 70lbs. They could both slip out of these. I returned and ordered Medium."
1,Great story line. Jet Li played an excellent role. Full of action and comedy.
1,"This is the final book in the Vatta's War Series.

Overall this is solid sci-fi action. Nothing exceptional, just fine. It would probably be hard to follow if I hadn't read the previous books, but all the characters are growing nicely into their roles, and the plot rolls along to a satisfying conclusion. It's a quick read, and I enjoyed it fine.

Except for one thing.

The very end is just terrible. The end of the plot about a pirate fleet taking over systems and disrupting communication is fine, obvious, but fine. But after that ends, the book goes on to give a tag about the end of the romantic tension between two of the lead characters. It's a terrible scene. I mean, it's short, but just ridiculous. Not funny, not romantic: I was embarrassed on the characters' behalf. The romance isn't built up in a way that should lead to a scene that is so juvenile. For another character, in another plot, sure, whatever, it's corny but might be okay.

For this it just left me with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole book."
1,"You're paying less than 10bucks for a pair of headphones.  If you're and audiophile and crystal clear sound and deep bass are your thing, don't get them.  For normal use they cancel out surrounding sound, don't sound 'tinny' like other cheap earbuds. I actually only have two complaints.  The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.  Wrapping it around the provided 'cord manager' will cause this as well if left for long periods of time.

Overall, great earbuds.  Using with my ipad for gaming/movies and iphone for music and games."
1,"I really enjoyed this book. It was a fun read that kept me interested. I couldn't help feeling for what Paige went through as a kid and how it shaped her life and her families. It truly shows how when one person in a family is ill, it affects everyone.

I'm glad that Paige grew up strong and was able to finally make her life away from her family, and have a little independence that she sorely needed. When Paige loses her job she pulls herself up and takes charge of her life and becomes her own boss.

A big move, but one she's ready for.

You'll really enjoy how both Paige and Jake grow. Because Jake is Paige's brother Matt's friend he is taboo to her, and vice versa. But somethings the heart wants what the heart wants.

Of course at times I wasn't always a fan of Jake's attitude, but as the book progressed he got better. I'm really looking forward to the next book in this enjoyable series.

0,"One day I accidentally dropped it on the ground and it was all over my workbench.  I wasn't sure if it would be a good idea to put it in a trash can or not.  It's in a large storage box.  I was worried it might not be the best idea to put it in the trash, but it is the best I've found.  I love the fact that it has a nice rubber grip on it.  It's very easy to open it.  I've used it on my bench, too, and it works great!  I'm glad I found it.I have used this for a couple of months now.  It is very easy to install and does a good job.  It is a bit pricey and I had to go with a brand new one.  However, the metal screws are a nice feature.  I don't really like the mounting hardware but I will probably get a good one for the kitchen.  This is a great tool for the price.  I would definitely recommend it.I received this product at a discount on Amazon, at a discount on Amazon Prime.

1,"This is a fun and innovative toy that gets kids outside and exploring nature. My 6 year old had so much fun peeking around trees to see what he could find in the woods. He even had fun pretending that he was looking for Big Foot. The handles are very easy to hold, and the periscope is light weight making it easy to bring on a nature walk or hike. My 3 year old even had a blast playing with it. The periscope can be used inside as well to peek behind couches and ""spy"" on siblings or parents. That makes it a great toy for sunny AND rainy days! The light makes it fun to explore at night too so this would be a great toy to bring on a camping trip! This periscope is also durable which is a must when being used by little ones! I received the periscope from Educational Insights at no charge in exchange for my completely honest review."

The story takes place in a fictional world where the human race has been given the opportunity to explore their own unique abilities and abilities. The story is told from the perspective of a young girl who is facing a difficult journey to become a strong leader and a powerful leader.

Because of it's soft nature, the fluff is a little more than half the photo width.

1,This movie did everything that fans of the Marvell series were hoping for.  It brought the heroes of the different movies together.  The interactions deepened our understanding of their characters.  It expanded the sense of the background Universe that all of these characters inhabit.  And it had really well designed set pieces and action sequences.
1,"This book was so great. Just a heads up though -- if you haven't read the other books (like me), you'll be a little lost. Not so much that you can't follow the story, but definitely enough to make you go, ""Uuuhhhhhh, who are these people?""

That being said, I do not regret buying this book. It was steamy and super amazing! I can't wait to read more books from Sapphire!"

1,I probably should give this 5 stars because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one was damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;)

A velcro strip attached near the end of the ""big connector"" end is a thoughtful addition allowing you to loop the cord for storage or to neatly reduce the length during use.  Definitely recommend."

0,"These are very simple to install. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.

I had to replace a couple of the light fixtures in the house and it's still working well. It's a little pricey for a new light fixture but it's cheaper than the other lights. I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see. I just installed them with the wire stripper and they work great. It's very easy to program and to program them for a specific purpose. You can program them for a specific area by either clicking on the box and selecting the desired color, or by turning on/off the light. I'll be using them for the new home and I hope they last a long time. I've had no problems with them so far.

The installation instructions were good but I found myself wanting to return them. They were a little hard to follow but I figured that was the end of it. The instructions were very simple and the instructions were helpful.

1,"This little portable router worked perfectly, with the setup minimal.  Only thing missing was a case or pouch to carry it.

I went to Las Vegas recently with my Nexus 7 tablet, which does not have a wired ethernet port.  I also assumed that some of the hotels in Vegas still had wired internet connections in their rooms.  My stay was at the Monte Carlo, which only has the wired connection in the room.  So I plugged cable into this router in the Access Point mode, which in turn sends out wi-fi signals that my Nexus7 picked up.  A couple of tabs on the Nexus7 to accept the hotels terms, etc. and I had internet access.  I was able to check my emails, etc. in my room.  Since the hotel charges you a daily fee which includes Internet access, might as well put it to good use.

So this TP-Link router worked as advertised.  Plug in the required cables, setup was almost automatic, and instant wi-fi connection to the Internet.  The price was great too."

1,"Isn't it nice when some works out exactly the way it is supposed to?  I picked up a pair of Sony bookshelf speakers at a thrift shop months ago and decided it was time to mount them.  But I wanted a mounting that was simple, cheap, and effective, took a chance on these satellite speaker mounts and found them to be perfect.

The mounts can fit both single screw speakers (like my Sony) and double screw speakers, they can also be set up to be longer (about 5"") or shorter (about 3"") and come with the screws and hardware to mount to the speaker and to the wall (including dry wall anchors)  The mounts also include the Allen wrench necessary to adjust the mounts and permit the speaker to be oriented just about in any direction or attitude.

With the help of my cordless screwdriver, I had both speakers mounted nicely on the wall in about 15 minutes.  (And that includes looking over the included instructions until I realized that one could actually ignore them.)  Now these aren't the most beautiful speaker mounts, and they are plastic so don't try and mount some huge 20-lb speaker.  But for mounting small satellite speakers just about anywhere, these will work just fine, and at about $10 the price is just right."

1,"I have reviewed it before but for some reason it didn't get posted.

At first, I have received a default product, I have contacted seller on the same day as I received the product, seller responded lately because of the time difference but and he is very kind and responsible.

Seller resent me a new cutting and cooking set which my son is loving, he plays a lot with this set, though at first we didn't like it as much as we expected but as time has passed not only my son but even I am spending a lot of time with him while playing with this set, a lot of creative play. He cooks me egg plant and tomato most of times because he knew they are my favorite, he likes to use the salt and pepper shakes. Everything is excellently made except the ladle, in place of ladle we are using other wooden spoons.

we are so in love with this cooking and cutting set, our most favorite thing to play now.

P.S: my son is a 2.5yr old, he loves cooking and this is a super hit in my house hold now.

I have received this product at a discount for my honest review, which is what I do. The seller or his discount has nothing to do with my feedback, my words are from my own experience with the product."
1,"I enjoyed reading this book. Simone got glimpses of what a womanizer that Que was on their first date, but still chose to continue with him and invest her feelings. The ending tore at my heart strings.  On one hand I kind of felt bad for Que and on another hand I understand that Simone is fed up with his cheating and lies and wants to move on. Maybe Que has learned and Simone will reconsider.  We'll see. Can't wait for the next part."

1,A little smaller than my vintage 13 inch simply because this screen is wide and my old one was longer from top to bottom. But it serves the purpose quite nicely for the kitchen. I use it with my blu-ray dvd player and it is awesome. The sound is tinny even though I use external speakers. Don't know if a better pair of speakers would raise this rating but for the price of the TV I son't know if it would be worth the investment. I like it very much.
1,"LOVE at first warmth. I wear my fall riding gloves at 15' F and my hands still sweat. I have small bar ends. Not the long aluminum type shown on their website. I also don't want to remove my hands from the mitts to use the bar ends. I bought this model, no hole for bar ends, and I am able to use my bar ends without removing my hands. The fit is a bit tight even in XL size. The length from the end of the bars toward the stem could be an inch longer and it would work better.

There is a  velcro tiedown inside that straps to your handlebar but with bar ends it simply won't work in my case. If the velcro were at the bottom as opposed to the end of the mitt it would work. I may perform some minor surgery to move the velcro or punch some grommet holes to better attach the mitt to my bars. Otherwise it keeps wanting to slide off and I find myself yanking it back on all ride. It's not terrible but could be better."

1,"Jack Black recently released School of Rock, a film where he releases the inner rockers from the well to do children in a posh, private school.  Tenacious D is Jack's rock child let loose upon America.
Set in the open mike clubs of L.A. Jack and Kyle suffer misadventure after misadventure looking for ""insparado"" (the secret behind great song writing) and their next gig.
Like Spinal Tap, these guys are talented but have no idea how insipid and dumb their material is.  They perform with great energy and that raises them far above the songs they are singing.  In one episode Jack and Kyle are trying to write a new song and the melody is farmiliar.  As they stop to congratulate themselves on a job well done an ice cream truck goes by their apartment and they realize they've just put words to the ice cream song.  (And made it NC-17 in the process.  Something Good Humor may have an issue with)
Inventive, fresh and stupid in a good way, Tenacious D, the satan loving, clog dancing, spine piercing folk rockers, belongs on the shelf next to Molly Hatchet, Lynyrd Skynrd, and Iron Maiden."

1,"I bought this light not knowing what to expect so from the beginning:  Packing was great; the light arrives in a hard case that has fitted inserts that hold everything in place safely and comfortably, no hassle getting charger, light, and strap in and out. Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced. Thank goodness the flashlight has three light settings, I use the middle setting most of the time but its great to have options. Finally, the flashlight has a battery indicator that really comes in handy so I don't get caught short of charge."

0,"My last Rottweiler, Jet, was a little too big for him.  We tried a variety of pet bedding and we had to get a larger one for him.  After a lot of research we decided to try this one.  We were skeptical about the size of the bedding but we were a bit surprised at how well it worked.  It's a bit big for him but it's just right.  It's a nice size for a large dog.

We have a small dog that is about 1 1/2 inches tall, so he was a bit small for this bedding.  It's definitely a bit large for him.  We have to get the bedding from the fabric and we have to get it off the dog.  It's also a little heavier for him than other beds we have.

It's a nice size for a small dog.  We've had this bedding for about a year and it's still in good condition.  It's a little tight on the dogs neck but it's not too tight for the large dog.  The material is very soft and it's easy to tear off.  I've used it on my dogs all over the house and it looks nice and it's a little big for them.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this bedding and I think it will last a long time."

I purchased a Dolica Proline at the same time as this one. So far it has been a better, more durable tripod (overall).

This one out-performs the Dolica if it's being used for shooting videos though.

The Sony name is good, but this product is relatively brittle. I would recommend it only for someone who will use it for light-duty purposes.

But his love for Katie makes him want to be clean and have a life with her. He's trying to find a way to work where his problems with his hands don't interfere.

Definitely worth reading and looking forward to more of their story that comes out in January."

Like a potboiler, one roots for the heroine and relishes hating the bad guys.

I did get a free shipping label on the Minikeyboard but I was not expecting much.  I am not sure if I will get another one for my phone or if I will get a return label.  I will update this review as time goes on.

Pros:
-Easy to use
-Not too big
-No noise
-Small size
-No shipping label

Cons:
-There is a plastic part on the bottom.  It's not the part that is the issue but I would expect it to be.
-The battery cover is a bit flimsy.  It doesn't stay in place well.  It's about the size of a small bottle of water.  I guess it would be more than I would like for a laptop.

1,"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.  I hope Vantec will see this review for the next design model."

1,"I loved this book! It's full of adventure and courage with a good deal of history thrown in.

The Siege Winter opens during the brutal civil war between Stephen of Blois and Empress Mathilda, during which the common people suffered terribly from depredations on both sides. A young girl of the fens is brutally attacked and left for dead as she and her sisters flee the soldiers and brigands that prey on the locals.  She is rescued by Gwil and becomes Penda, a young boy. Together Gwil and Penda struggle to survive in the time when ""god and his saints slept"".

The story is recounted by an abbot on his deathbed to a young scribe. The character's are varied: Maud, a young noblewoman who is traded back and forth between the two sides in the war as if she was as much a piece of property as her actual property; William, Maud's stepson who is torn between devotion to his awful father and Maud; King Stephen and Empress Mathilda; and various other players. The action is constant, and is both mental and physical as the characters try to stay alive in the brutal war. And then there is the evil monk...who is he, and why does he have such power?

This is Ariana Franklin's last book; she died before it was completed and her daughter completed it. It's a wonderful book and a great tribute to her. I wish she were still around to write more great books!"

1,"I purchased both the 10 inch queen and the 12 inch King mattresses. I am extremely impressed with both mattresses They were delivered on time and very nicely packed in a right sized box. The mattresses puffed up to full size in about 45 minutes with no odor. They feel magnificent, just the right amount of softness with solid support. We purchased the 10 inch queen for the guest room and after trying it out we immediately replaced our king with the 12 inch DreamFoam, it was that good. DreamFoam bedding has my highest recommendation. I really couldn't be more satisfied. Our previous mattress cost three times as much and wasn't nearly as comfortable. Buy this mattress, you won't regret it. Also, thank you for making good on the three day delivery right to my front door. I know this review sounds too good to be true. It has been a long time since I have been this happy with a purchase. Both mattresses really did exceed my expectations."

They were so well done that I had to buy a complete set so that I could watch every episode, in order, to get the full amazing story of Easy Company.  One of the very few WWII dramas that can approach the quality of Saving Private Ryan, this is a must see for anyone who loves WWII history, or just appreciates great war dramas."

1,"This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered."

As far as I can tell this is a true 16awg and the wire strips and cuts evenly, not the thin flimsy cheap copper coated aluminum crap. Good for current, good for speakers, you name it.

Yes, the jacket makes the wire run heavier and thicker and takes up more space in a run of loom, but I'd rather have the extra protection under the hood or beneath my vehicle or around my house.

Another added benefit for me was the fact that the book is 100+ pages- not too long and not too short. It gives you enough tips and tricks without stuffing your head with unnecessary facts and info.

The workouts were very easy to follow and the photographs really helped me to get a better idea of how to do the moves. I found this to be an absolutely fantastic book for kettle bell training and would recommend it to others without hesitation."

The Thing i am most impressed with in the richness in color and detail in Evie's hair. The dark blue/purple really pop's and both dolls are a great likeness to their Disney Show character's.

The dolls are made from standard plastics and are fully articulated for lots of pose-able playable fun.  These would make a great gift for a fan of the show or a little girl who loves dolls."

1,"I liked the story.  By now you know what the story is about so I won't go into that.  I thought the storyline was good.  I did feel sorry for the Hero who was cheated out of 10 years of his son's life.  He was 2 years older than her and she was a college graduate, so he had to be around 25 or so.  I think in his drunken state he was just popping off more than he really meant the words he said.  I realize to make the story work she had to run.

She did make a lot of dumb choices and she did seem very immature and weak when she was suppose to be such a strong character.  I could almost deal with all of that.  What got on my last nerve, and SPOILER here, was her insecurities.  Good grief, what does a guy have to do to convince you he means what he says.  She did take responsibility for some of her bad choices so I will give her that.  She was rather annoying and not a heroine that inspired a lot of affection.  Seems he was made to grovel and she was the one that ran rather than staying and discussing things with him.  But, this is one of those stories you need to read for yourself.  I found it very interesting and I definitely would recommend it.  I did read some of the low star reviews and I had to agree with a lot of what they said but I did like the story."

It does not have a lot of straps on it, but it is very comfortable for the dog. I would highly recommend this harness.I've had these for about a month now and have had a couple of complaints.  They do not work at all.  We bought a larger size and found that they are a bit too small for my 18 lb. Yorkie.  I will be replacing them all.  I guess I'll have to get another one.  We just have to figure out how to keep them from getting in the way of our dogs.  I'm not sure how much of this is because we don't have a large dog.

The quick start guide was passable, I ended up using the PDF version of the full manual instead.

It's about the challenge of leading a decent life. That so many Israelis descend from Jews who were persecuted by Christians and Moslems for over a thousand years is part of the ""flavor"" of being Israeli. That, and the fact that Jews are one of the few remnants of the ancient world who retain their religious-mythological world and refer to it, consciously and instinctively, in every thought and action. ""Devarim"" is neither hopeful nor hopeless. It's just how things are. But in Israel, as opposed to France, German, Italy, etc. , what we see is not ""fancy."

Chamberlain cannot override their password so unless you know the person and can have them release the product for you to use, Do not buy it used. This happened to me and I can say that the Chamberlain representative was very pleasant and very helpful. They explained it to me and said all they could do was send me a new one, which they did.

I find myself wanting to hear the songs instead of cringing with them. The buttons also have a relatively predictable response, which I think is good for baby's learning.  All in all, we are very happy with this toy and my twins love it!"

I would recommend it if you don't want to have to carry a suit in a suit to go to the gym.  If you have a lot of room for a suit, then I would suggest it to you.I like the size of this bag.  It is light weight and the handles are very secure.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight backpack.I like the design of this product.

I have used it for about a year and it still works.I really like these gloves.  I have had a few pairs of these in the past and they are very comfortable and good quality.  They do have some sizing issues but it is good for the price.

1,"I am so impressed with this Micro SD Adaptor.  Not only it fits in my Dell XPS15, 9560, but it is very well made.  It is much more expansive than other micro SD adapters.  The card is little bit shorter (about 0.5mm) than the depth of the SD card slot (see attached photo) because it is not made for the XPS15, 9560, but it is not a problem.  There is no problem removing it from the laptop with you finger nail.  The manufacturer is not planning to make a custom fitting card adapter for the new Dell XPS15, 956-0, so you have to settle for this adapter if you are looking for flush fitting Micro SD Adapter.  When buying this adapter, make sure to get the right model (103A).  The other models made by BaseQi are either too short or too long or do not fit at all.
Prior to buying this, I bought a very inexpensive plastic adapter, and it destroyed the SD card slot's internal card contacts on the first try.  I had to replace the laptop motherboard to correct the damaged card slot.  Yes, the card reader slot is embedded on the motherboard, so there was no other solution but replacing the entire motherboard.  Yes, it was an over $1,000.00 mistake.  You get what you pay for.
I am very happy with this product."

First off I have to tell Amelie S. Duncan that I ABSOLUTELY LOVED Piper Dreams!  You can ask my husband how many times I moved out of my chair since I started reading this book.  I think 3 times just for potty breaks and lunch!  I read this book straight through and even though I really do have a lot to do today I couldn't because I was glued to my chair reading!

Amelie S. Duncan, girl you can write a HOT & SEXY book!  I love Brody (Broderick Whitehurst) & Piper Rowe.  Oh and I really need to read more of Serendipity please!  What a great story!  Oh and please tell I don't have to wait too long until Part 2.

1,"Don't let the manila fool you, this is a comfortable and soft rope. The braiding is tight and the quality excellent. There is little to no fear that it will fray into your hands, the way some cheap manila ropes will. The 1.5"" diameter is perfect for my children to grip, and is also good for adults. The rubberized coating on the end should last a while if we keep it from dragging all over the ground.

Compared to synthetic/poly climbing ropes bought by some friends (on Amazon), it is much easier to hold and grip. It's not slippery like they are. I think this one is much safer for the little hands.

At the end of the day, it's a rope you toss over a tree limb to climb and swing. But it's more quality than I expected for the price."
1,"Installation instructions were good, sturdy mount to wall, well made.

1,"Mounted this on the back of my 32 foot camper. Used their 50 foot extension cable and mounted the transmitter on the front of the camper. It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.  I use this with the Garmin RV 770 LMT-S.  For a camper or truck, this is the most awesome GPS I have ever owned, and matched with this camera, its simply indispensable."

I find it funny the power movies have over us and the brainwashing that it tries to do.  In this movie they try to make you feel bad for homosexuals, make you feel unmarried sexual relationships are okay because of loneliness, and that marriages that are strained should just end.  They show the only married couple splitting and doing it as easy as ""turning left"".  Besides this lack of morality I did enjoy the movie."

1,"My problem- I didn't check the dimensions. Smaller than I expected and wanted but as described-kinda. The pouch will hold a tennis ball (if you push hard) but not a ball  and treats. The outside pouch will not hold a tennis ball , for the size it will hold, that size is small enough to choke your dog. It does have an inside pocket about the size of a clicker. When the pull string is tightened, it cuts off the top 1/3 of the pouch space. The construction is very durable and nicely done. So, if you have a small dog with a small ball, tiny poop bag(s), and tiny treats then this bag is great for you! My dog is a 100lb Wht. G. Shep who likes to fetch a baseball bat and tennis balls. Oh well, my error not Amazon or the seller(description a bit misleading)...I have used the treat bag now and find it great for a lot of smaller treats for my dog and probably better and less costly than the larger treats he was getting. He doesn't care since I break the larger treats to smaller bites. The ball pocket..nah..use it for a bag or clicker. I like this purchase!"

Mr. & Mrs. no relationships. They have an instant attraction but do not want to be involved with each other because of their friends. They think it will just complicate a already complicated situation with Natasha & Felix, but their chemistry is too strong and situations too intense to break the bond they have. Instead it turns it from friends to lovers. The desire for each other becomes too much and they change their relationship! I absolutely love these two as a couple. The chemistry Krissy created between these two is amazing. You can feel it deep down. This is defiantly one of those books that just makes you happy!!! Can't wait to read what amazing story you come up with next. SO much love for this book!!"

The Mega Bloks HALO aircraft always make an impressive item while being both fun and challenging to build.
Priced at less than nine cents for each piece, this 716-piece kit is well worth buying.

1,"Somebody to Love is the third book in the Cupid, Texas series by Lorie Wilde.  Jericho Chance is a sexy cowboy turn scholar.  He knows what he wants from life and how he is going to get it.  The only thing that throws him off is how much he wants his best friend Zoe McCleary.  Jericho biggest issue with Zoe is she does not commit to anything.

Zoe McCleary says and does whatever pops into her head.  She is still in school because she has changed her major multiple time.  She is at a point the guardian in charge of her trust tells her to pick something and stick it through or he is giving all her money away.  Zoe comes across as flighty and unreliable.  It seems the one thing that no one sees is that Zoe is head over heels in love with Jericho.  That is the one thing she sticks too.

The chemistry between Zoe and Jericho is blistering.  I loved that they finally acted on their feeling for each other.  The sex scenes were steamy.  My biggest issue with this book is that everyone including Jericho seem to constantly put Zoe down.  While Jericho does, stick up for her he seems to agree with those picking on her.  I wonder if any of those ever thought that Zoe unable to commit had something to do with worrying about what everyone around her was saying and constantly trying to please those around her.

I found this book very well written.  The main and secondary characters were interesting and realistic.  I loved that there was a story line beyond just Zoe and Jericho falling in love with each other.  While I have not read the other books in the series, this book can be read and enjoyed as a standalone novel.  Overall, this was a great story.  I will be picking up the other books in the series shortly."

I do love not getting kitty attached (meow'ed excessively) anymore because she knows that at a certain time the noise comes and she eats. I just wish it was for a full 7 days to make it easier for me to remember to fill it. The numbers are at the bottom of each 1 cup section but black on black is hard for me to see. I've had it for almost a month and my cat was eating out of it in a few minutes the first day, the 2nd day almost no hesitation and after than, she sits quietly by it up to an hour before the timer opens the compartment and as soon as it starts to shift, she's eating.

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

Honestly, I can't recommend it highly enough."

1,"I'm very happy with these inexpensive manifolds. However, my crimper does not fit once the first line is crimped on (copper rings). I have a custom made threaded-bolt crimper that I bought from eBay - it's a life saver and fits perfectly into these small manifolds. The guy makes them on a CNC machine. The bolt crimper requires you to tighten two heavy duty bolts with a socket wrench but it allows you to get into tight spaces like this manifold and has cutouts for 1"", 3/4"", 1/2"" and 3/8"" - that's a lot of tool for like $40.

1,"Benedict and Yeager describe a vast array of criminal patterns of dozens  of current and former NFL players -- including some hideous and barbaric  acts for which certain players suffered far too little (if any!) jail time.  Because of the variety and brutality of the crimes described, more than  the quality of the writing itself, the book is riveting reading; although  there is a strongly sensationalistic, tabloid-style undercurrent to the  whole piece which may repulse more careful readers.  I finished this book  with three outstanding impressions:
1) Far too little attention is given  to the successful redemption of specific players who have stopped their  criminal ways and become solid, admirable citizens (e.g.,  ""Hollywood"" Henderson or Cris Carter);
2) The writes make a  convincing argument that the pampering which star players recieve in late  childhood immunizes them (in their minds) from consequences for their  actions; and
3) The authors clearly intended to be shocking at least as  much for their own fame and fortune as for any noble social reform.  After  all, these criminal records are public, and were already well documented in  the popular sports media.

Serious football fans and sociologists alike  should read this book to learn of a surprisingly sinister element that is  liberally sprinkled among Sunday's heroes.  But while reading, cast a  healthy dose of skepticism at the intent of the writers."

I just thought this was an excellent film. As a low budget indie you couldn't ask for anything more. If there was a few million behind it, and some stars in the main roles, this film could be a blockbuster.

Why? Because it's credible. A few years from now, something like this WILL be happening, as AI influences people, AI becomes as real as real people, and it has the chance to become all powerful.

We meet a few new characters and I loved them all! Some we see more then others but the way they are in this book, they play a big role. We get to see a few from the old book that make you angry and some make you some.

This one picked up where the last book left off and omg it was such a wild ride. Finishing it at 1am my time, it was one of those books I couldn't put off reading because I had to know how they ended. Did they get their happy ending? That was my main question and I got my answer. While how it ended threw me for a loop, I was ok that that ending.

Overall, the author did an amazing job at keeping me invested in these characters lives. That's a huge plus in the writing world where there are so many books being released. I would like to see full books of atleast one of the secondary characters but I don't think that's going to happen. But a girl can dream.

1,"I bought this hat to wear on a three-day stay at the Western Southern Tennis Tournament in Mason, Ohio.  It performed beautifully through sunny, rainy, and sometimes very windy weather.  Good thing for the chin strap because you would not want the hat to blow off while sitting up high in the stadium seats.  I noticed other tennis enthusiasts had similar OR hats, but I was very pleased with mine and glad I purchased it online.  And it's a good thing the hat can be put into a washing machine because it did get a little dirty after three days of wear.  The best feature of the hat is that the back extends down far enough to cover the neck and keep it from being burned by the sun.  The adjustable chin strap and the toggle at the back allow you to get a fit exactly to your head size that is comfortable and stylish at the same time."

1,"Play-doh equipment has always looked super fun on the shelf at the store.  However most of the time when you get it home, it either breaks, you lose pieces, or it just doesn't work as well as it should.  The Candy Cyclone does come with a lot of easy to lose parts, and not a great way to store them.  The most amazing part for me is that when done properly, this thing actually works.

Couple of things we have learned when using this.  If the back of the toy is open at all, the crank will not turn (this is to ensure safety I presume).  If you put a huge chunk of play-doh into it, it won't work.  You have to make thinner logs, and then feed it into the machine, which will then make little balls roll down the track.  If you stuff a lot in, then you're going to be opening up the back trying to get play-doh out, which is quite annoying and hard.  You can then take these little play-doh balls and use the stamper to turn them into other little things.  It's gotten a lot of us from our daughter (who is 2 1/2) and also her cousins, (4-6) who also spent lots of time playing with it.

Things that could be improved, ideally there would be a way or a tool to make the correct shaped log, or a way to just stuff play-doh in and it still work without jamming up."

1,"""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is the last of Coelho's trilogy that explores the parameters of Good and Evil and their impact on the human soul.  In this story a stranger, battered and disheartened by the absolute worse that life can dish out, visits a small town with the intentions of carrying out an experiment aimed at assuaging some of his bitterness and pain.  While in the village, he enlists the help of Miss Prym who, bored with small town living, sees an opportunity for escape; but at what cost?  As the story unfolds the people of Viscos learn of the experiment and how they, collectively and individually, can benefit from it.  It is Coelho's interrogation of the villagers' intentions that provides the reader with a glimpse of the dueling forces of good and evil.

The novel is very well translated as I never felt that something was missing while reading it.  The language is loaded with meaning and highly symbolic.  ""Viscos is just like any other village in the world and whatever happens there happens in every continent, city, camp, convent, wherever.""  This is the wisdom shared with Miss Prym by Berta, the village's aged sage who spends her days watching over the village in an effort to see any evil coming.  I've always enjoyed Coelho's work and ""The Devil and Miss Prym"" is no different.  This is a solid story that's easily read and internalized.  Ultimately, what we learn about good and evil from this text sounds a lot simpler than I expected and much more easily articulated than done.  This is a quick yet profound read.  Highly Recommended."
1,"The story: Betrayed by her new husband, lovely Scottish bride Iolanthe MacLeod dies by the sword in the fall of 1382 in a landlocked keep on the English moors, far from the sea she loves. She gives up on her dreams of a man coming to rescue her and spends the next 600 years haunting the castle were she was killed. However, when Thomas McKinnon arrives to see the castle he purchased in 2001, she  recognizes him as the man from her dreams. At first all Thomas wants to do is restore his crumbling old castle, but he finds himself falling in love with a ghost. Now all he has to do is find a way for Iolanthe to become a permanent part of his world.
  This is my first book to read by Lynn Kurland, and to be fair, it would have been better if I had read her other books first. She has a whole series on the MacLeods/MacKinnons/De Piagets. However, I do think that books in a series should be able to stand on their own and this falls a little short. There are too many back stories that need to be explained, and a lot of loose ends that are not tied (presumably these will be explained in later books).
  This story does invovle time travel, and ghosts, so it requires a lot of imagination on the reader's part. The relationship between Thomas and the ghost inhabitants of the castle is quite funny and some of the supporting characters are quite likable. I loved the part where Iolanthe uses Thomas's computer to teach the garrison how to read. The part of the story where Thomas rescue's Iolanthe is also quite exciting and romantic. There are no love scenes in this book, only a few kisses and embraces. There is some violence and descritpions of battle scenes. If you like books in a series, I would recommend this book, but if not, then you may want to skip this one.

1,"I give five stars to Joby Warrick's The Triple Agent.  Warrick writes without political agenda, bias, or sensationalism.  In clear language, Warrick tells how tells how the CIA was duped by physician-turned-suicide bomber Humam Balawi.  Warrick conducted over two hundred interviews, on three continents, to piece together Walawi's story.  Yet, despite the incredible amount of information Warrick amassed, he tells the story in a clear, but intelligent, manner.

While most of The Triple Agent is well-documented, here and there Warrick did engage in speculation.  Speculation which has a logical bais, but which cannot be verified.  For instance, Warrick reports what Balawi saw at a border crossing and what he saw in his rear view mirror.  Balawi may have seen things exactly as Warrick claims, but as Balawi is dead there is no way to know for sure.
Still, given that the overall storyline is well-documented, such petty speculations are benign.

In short, The Triple Agent is well worth reading for anyone anyone interested in Al-Qaeda and modern spycraft."

For me, this was not a ""page-turner"" and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome.

0,"I have become a fan of the series and have enjoyed all of her books. She does a great job of portraying the characters. The characters are complex, and the plots are very interesting. She keeps you guessing and in the end you will be right there with them. The author does a great job of explaining how to create and use non-fiction books. I think this book is a good book for anyone who has a little knowledge about the world of science fiction. I think that this book is a great introduction to the series."

1,"Any praise for Gaiman's The Graveyard Book seems anticlimactic after its being awarded the prestigious Newberry Award, but I couldn't read this book without saying a few words about it on the offhand chance that one or more of my readers may have been hiding under a rock for the past few months. I passed this book up actually, the first time I saw it. It seemed like a book for younger audiences, and it is, but when I picked it up a month or so later (peer pressure's a serious bitch) I found it entertaining myself. It tells the story of Nobody Owens, a toddler who escapes to a graveyard when his family is murdered, and follows him up to his teenage years. He's raised by the ghosts who live in the cemetery and has a variety of adventures involving ghouls, a werewolf, a dead witch, a dance between the living and the dead and more. Most of the chapters in the middle of the book could be stand-alone short (and bedtime) stories. The end of the book, Nobody's confrontation with his family's killer, is over about as quick as it begins, and that's a bit jarring, but forgiveable because that's not what the book is supposed to be about anyhow. I passed The Graveyard Book on to my teenage daughter when I finished it, and I think I'd enjoy seeing this one as a movie, in the same vein as Coraline. 4."

1,"I have friends who are SCCA corner workers and others who are EMTs and Firefighters. Both are jobs that can involve cutting, prying open, grabbing hot or sharp things, etc.  I saw this as a good tool to keep in my car to use ""just in case"" I had a chance to be a hero, like my friends. But first, I brought it to church to show my firefighter friend and get his thoughts. Here's what he said:

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

Quality build, several useful tools, a little heavy, worth a try for the heros in your life!"
1,"There are two things that might be of interest to some viewers. One is that director of ""Solstice"" is Daniel Myrick, who co-directed a hugely successful horror ""The Blair Witch Project"" in 1999 (with Eduardo Snchez). The other is his latest film stars Shawn Ashmore (""Iceman"" of the ""X-Men"" franchise) and Amanda Seyfried (a young bride-to-be in ""Mamma Mia!""). As a horror film, however, ""Solstice"" offers little more than familiar scares and ineffective narrative despite its stars, beautifully shot photography and some intriguing narrative elements.

""Solstice"" follows the story of Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) trying to recover from one shocking incident that happened to her family, and her friends Christian, Zoe, Mark and Alicia. They travel to a quiet lake house for their annual summer trip, where Megan starts experiencing strange things, like seeing things. Megan comes to believe that some supernatural presence is trying to contact her, perhaps her twin sister Sophie, to let Megan know some secrets. Or maybe she is mistaken.

I can't reveal it in detail, but in the second half of the film an interesting development takes place as Megan realizes the truth about the weird images she continues to see. But the film's slow-paced earlier part is boring with clichd devices such as moving shadows and a ""creepy"" old guy (R. Lee Ermey). In the end of the film everything is explained and some of the characters, including R. Lee Ermey's ""Leonard,"" show unexpected sides, but it takes too long (more than 50 minutes) before the film reaches that point.

According to the opening credit, ""Solstice"" is based on a 2003 Danish film ""Midsommer."" Perhaps something is lost in translation. Perhaps not. Whichever it is, I feel there is a better movie buried in here."

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!"

1,"I usually buy Ravensburger puzzles, but I liked this vintage seed packets picture so decided to give White Mountain a try seeing as it had good reviews. Sadly, the quality wasn't very good. Lots of hanging chads, ripped backings and pieces which were still joined together. On the corner of one piece, the picture was beginning to lift up off the cardboard. Not traditional shaped puzzle pieces - various angles and sizes throughout the puzzle. The pieces are larger than usual - good for someone with impaired vision. Not that challenging - easily completed in an afternoon. Personally, wouldn't buy again, but a nice picture if you had to buy puzzles with larger pieces."
1,"I'm a huge fan of MC books but am not really that familiar with the world of BDSM so I was determined to read this book with an open mind. From the prolog B. b had me hooked to read the story of Colt and Tuesday. I loved that girls attitude from the get go, I loved the way they met and how their world's literally colieded. Their backstories are masterfully intertwined with their present and just made you want to be part of their journey even more and get to know them and the family that Colt introduces Tuesday to. Colts explanation of family to Tuesday is perfect:

""You were raised believin' family is in your name - that it has something to do with blood. ""
""It has nothing to do with that s*** - that's all accidental b. s - the s*** your born into that you can't f***in' control. ""
""Family, are the people who are there for you, who've got your back, and you know dam good and well, you've got theirs too! You don't just run away from them!""

Tuesday has some knowledge of Colts world but from a twisted dangerous point of view, he introduces her to a safe version of the world of BDSM, that has her wanting more. Along the way you learn how his bond with his brother Kash was formed, you learn how important trust can be and the lengths the brothers will go to, to protect their family. I've loved Colts journey so far and can't wait for his brother Kash' to begin."
1,"My 1 yr old son received this as a gift. Wish I wouldn't have tossed the box so we could return it! It collapses to easily (just while playing), the gears do not stay on- as soon as you turn either on the end they ALL pop off, and the nails pretty much fall right into the holes. If you are looking for a toy for your little boy (or girl ) to tinker around with I highly suggest the LeapFrog Fix and Learn Speedy. The drivers are a wrench and screw driver that are very toddler friendly to grasp and 'work' with, cutesy (not annoying) songs, it cues when something on Speedy breaks and needs some fixing and of course doubles as a race car. Speedy gets played with daily by my son (which says a lot for a toy). If you have a toddler that is more interested in tinkering rather than necessarily playing (like my little guy), check out Speedy, NOT this workbench!"

1,"I use this router at the receiving end of a wireless bridge between the two floors of my apartment, and also as a print and file server. I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer. Aside from the printer trouble, I only had to reboot the router for firmware updates and I never experienced any connection issues whatsoever."
1,"Got these as a housewarming gift for a best friend who had moved into a house with 1 picture window and 3 oversized side windows.

A decent heavy duty curtain rod will cost at least $20.00 for one window (not including the curtain rod bracket).
P.S.:  The curtain rod idea is just a FYI DIY for those looking to save a money and need a heavy duty curtain rod.  I use conduit pipes and copper (L) pipes as curtains rods for curtains with grommets throughout my house.

My favorite stories were ""How the Lotus Blossoms"" (a possible origin for the barbaric foot-binding tradition in China, ""Buktu's Well"" (possible beginnings of the Timbuktu trading post in Mali), ""The Girl with the Golden Eye"" (a young woman with a prosthetic eye sees the future during orgasm), and ""Queen of Beauty"" (possible explanations for the mystery surrounding Nefertiti's unfinished bust and her disappearance after her husband's death).

Also, Dell makes it nearly impossible to find the software for this thing on their website. It is not detected by their support helper application and does not seem to have the ""service tag"" that is needed to find drivers and other software for your machine. There's tons of software to choose from one you do find it, but it's pure luck to download and install the correct software as everything is named the same and not labeled appropriately for specific machines and operating systems (it LOOKS like it is, but I have downloaded many packages for this device that indicate my specific laptop and OS, only to get a message that says :this software does  not work with this machine"" upon trying to install. Hugely frustrating and a gigantic fail on Dell's part."

1,"Nine years ago, Alex Delaware successfully treated Melissa Dickinson, a tormented and phobic young girl, irrationally scared of almost everything. After two years of treatment, Melissa seems almost totally recovered, so her need for Dr Delaware ceases, and she becomes one of his most spectacular triumphs. Now, Melissa contacts Alex again, this time seeking advice concerning her mother. Gina Dickinson is a recluse, an ex-actress hiding away from the world ever since a vicious acid attack that left her scarred for life, even after extensive and traumatic plastic surgery. Even though Gina is now seeing, with some effect, a psychiatrist of her own, Melissa wants to know if Alex feels her mother could cope if she went away, accepting her place Harvard. Then, one day, Gina inexplicably climbs into her car, and drives off into thin air, leaving a tangled mystery to be unravelled in her wake.
I had started to think that this series was in danger of going stale. The prose is adequate and easy to read, but hardly full of spirit and at times seems a little perfunctory, and Alex Delaware has also remained a rather static - if very likeable - character. But now, after reading Kellerman's excellent standalone ""The Butcher's Theatre"", I returned to the series with ""Private Eyes"", and found it a wonderfully invigorating experience. This may be his lone of his longest Delaware books to date, but every word is fascinating, and there seems to me to be fresh fire in the writing. The characters are all very well developed, and although Kellerman never really takes any risks with his well-structured plot, it's a complex and clever book that really kicks the brain into gear, and presents one or two nice surprises along the way.
The psychology is dead-on, the relationships are all fascinating, the characterisation is acute, and the resolution is exciting, well-done, and satisfying. This may well turn out to be the rock of the Delaware series. To find out, i shall have to read on..."

1,"I got this cover with the idea of having a spare in case I messed up removing material to make the Qi adapter fit better (trying to reduce the lump it makes). It fits nicely, and seems to be pretty thin (which I wanted). My only slight complaint is that it isn't exactly what I'd call RED red. It's more of a dusty red, or a very dark pink. Kind of rosy, perhaps? Anyways, it actually works out okay for me because it matches the red portion of my Supcase Unicorn Beetle black/red case very VERY well. It's really hard to match reds, and the red of the case isn't particularly red, either. However, the color of the case and cover are so close as to pretty much be the same, which is great for me. A tiny ring of red now peeks out around the case's camera hole. I'm about to upload a picture, check it out. I think it looks pretty damn good. On a side note, and it doesn't bother me at all for my purposes - the cover isn't exactly what I'd call rubberized. I was expecting something perhaps a little grippy and more textured, but the cover is basically just matte finish. If it's actually ""rubberized"", then it's the thinnest rubber coating I've ever seen. If I ordered this with the intention of not using it with a case and having a grippy rear cover, I'd be pretty upset. Really, for my own purposes this is a 5 star product, but I think if I didn't have this narrow use-case, I'd have called it 4 stars. So there ya go."

0,"While our daughter is serving time in the US, we've tried a lot of different foods and we've found that the best thing for her to get through her food bowl is to go to the bathroom and look at the food in her bowl. If she doesn't like the food, she'll eat it.

Our daughter also loves the chicken and rice dishes. She has a tendency to just eat the chicken and rice dishes and that's fine because she loves the food. She doesn't like the chicken and rice dishes, but she does like the chicken and rice dishes.

Overall, it's a great bowl that doesn't have a lot of waste. It's a bit difficult to clean, and we're using the same bowl for our dog. It's also a bit heavier, so it's not the best for small dogs.

This was short lived with each time I removed and replaced a stake in the attaching wall units. I first found my puppy chewing on the top cap that this company merely attaches by hand with no adhesive to ensure safety issues such as this. I wasn't happy to find an item my dog could have choked on in her ""safety"" area; I simply reattached it using crazy glue.

1,"I was excited to see a new Christian DD book because you don't see very many in the DD world. This book was okay the characters were young and still in high school so at times they came off as very immature. The town they lived in and the school they went to seemed a bit unrealistic, the fact that Ashley's father could go from never spanking her to as harsh as was felt unbelievable. Ashley's character really frustrated me the constant back and forth on her feelings for Jackson, and Jackson was really pushy about getting married. Throughout the book we get to watch them go through marriage classes and that's when it starts to feel like a ""how to"" book. There are only a few spanking scenes in this book and only one between Ashley and Jackson.
I would have liked more of the romance between Ashley and Jackson minus everyone else. A follow up would be nice!"

1,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

I got these to use for my DVR boxes, if you put a fan over the hdd of the DVR box, your box will last for years, otherwise every 2 or 3 years they will crap out on you, my DVRs have been here for over 5  years and I have 3. I think both fans are great and if you want control and more power then go with the Thermaltake, for DVR you only need about 2 inches of airflow so both fans are doing great for me.

1,"I purchased this product because my dishwasher used to always fill up with calcium deposits.  I was cleaning it every two months when the screens and holes in the wands would clog up.  I also had hard water stains on the faucets.

I was very skeptical about whether the product would actually work.  The science is hard to prove!

I installed one of these items on my incoming water supply.  I thought I would start there and then move it to just the hot water side if I wasn't getting the results I wanted.  Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).  It appears to have been a good decision for me.

I haven't yet had any problems with hard water so I haven't felt the need to move the unit to just the hot water pipe.

I think it's a bit too small for him to grasp on to and so far he hasn't had any problems with it. I think he will like it more as he gets older. Overall it is a great toy for the price. I bought this for my son who loves to build things and he has been doing it for a while now. It's great that he can build something that he can do with no help from the boys.

1,"This book was so inspiring as well as riveting.  Jenna has a wonderful talent for being totally honest about her life while at the same time conveying the lessons she's learned with wisdom and maturity.  She also talks a lot about relationships and just how hard they can be and when you really love someone just how much you have to put up with, and sometimes (when it comes to relationships) just when you should walk away.

  Aside from the interesting insights she gives regarding her own life (the way she writes in the book it sounds as if she's been through therapy) she also writes with quite a lot of sex appeal.  I'm not just talking about all the beautiful pictures but the way she talks about pleasure and sensuality.  As a woman I definitely found that this book helped reconnect me with my own sensuality.

This is definitely the kind of book you could read over again and still gain new insight, not to mention all the beautiful photographs."

1,"Wow. This for me is just vastly better than War and Peace. Instead of trying to sketch the entire Russian world, here he focuses in on 2-3 interrelated families. The psychological depth Tolstoy creates for Anna, Vronsky, Levin and all the rest of these people is just incredibly vivid. You feel their insecurities and longings like they're your own. The dialogue, both internal and external, is fantastic, and each character feels so real, so totally brimming over with this little moments of honesty and pathos. And the whole thing is grounded in small sensory details which make this whole world come vividly alive on almost every page, whether its a description of a nightgown flapping in the breeze, or the sensations of a hunter walking through the woods before dawn. There's no end of life in this book. Sorry to gush so much, but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the best crafted, most perfectly balanced 'big' 19th century books I've ever read. I'd recommend this to anyone"

1,"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.

 Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.

 Wonderboys will especially be appreciated by anyone who is a writer. The film will leave you with a thoughtful smile."

1,"Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers. They're fun and affordable and can save you lots of time bending over to turn things on."

1,"Over the last several months, I have received several stainless steel tumblers to test and review.  My husband is the hunting and fishing manager for an international chain sporting goods store, so we also receive a lot of stuff that they sell in the stores, to test at home.  Some of the first tumblers we were sent to try were from Yeti, and so many other brands have followed... Epic, Kodiak, Magnum Steel, Sic-sup, Rtic, and many more more.  This was the most recent cup that we have gotten to try.  We live in Texas, so we like ice cold drinks while we sit in the blazing hot sun.
After hand washing this cup, allowing it to air dry, it was filled with ice, and topped off with water.  Then is was off to the lake for a day in the hot sun! This cup performed very well throughout the day, and was even adopted by my father's girlfriend by the end of our trip.  (I usually give them to family or friends anyways, because we have several still)
The ice that we put in the cup early in the day lasted until we headed back home that night.  We refilled the water a few times, and did top the ice off throughout the day, but it kept the ice and drink just as cold as the other cups like this, that we had taken out there.
Not all of these tumblers perform as well as the top branded ones, but a few of them do stand out as being very good investments.  This cup is one of them! If it had not already been taken home by someone else, we would have been keeping it.

1,I swear I think American Dad and The Cleveland show is an excuse for Seth MacFarlane to get quick cash on suckers and idiots to watch this somewhat okay slop! I mean some of it is funny but Family Guy makes it funny from one random joke to another rather having a straight through plot point! I am not expert in criticizing  but I can take a wild armature's guess and get it right when I say this is okay but not close to being good as Family Guy! On the bright side this show has been cancelled but on the dark side American Dad is still kicking!

1,"I do not order articles of clothing unless I have tried them on in person. I have a difficult time finding clothes that fit. I decided to order this dress and crossed my fingers. I have never been more surprised at the fit!

I ordered the black dress with a red edge/outline on the neck and bow. The dress arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It was packaged in a plastic bag. I definitely would recommend upgrading to the gift-wrapping service if you are sending this dress as a gift.

I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.

The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL. I also was happy that I can wear my normal bras with this dress and the straps do not show, seriously, look at the pictures. The bra is not visible!

I am happy with the purchase so far but will update this review if there is an issue. I may only use this a couple hours on a date night so use is infrequent.

I am not connected in any way to this company but I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.

1,I don't see how this would be good for much of anything if you at all value the picture. It's a small window.  It's a cheap plastic that loosely fits and nothing to secure anything from falling out of the bottom.  Picture and plastic falls out and mine is inside.  Outside would surely ruin any photo you would try to use.  Obviously an economic product but protecting the photo should be a fundamental feature.
1,"I purchased one of these in Navy.  Speedo has outdone themselves, this is the best looking, most comfortable speedo I have seen in a long time.  The suite appears to be well made and the fit is incredible.  The fit is just right not to snug, not to loose.  I will definately purchase more of these, and will feel comfortable wearing them for tanning, at the beach or at the waterpark, they will look good anywhere.
I just purchased two more of these the red and black.  I thought the blue ones being so good might have been a accident but I got to admit the red and black are just as great.  I don't know what they have done to the fabric but I have never felt speedos feel so good next to my body.  There are so many color options they could add in this style I hope they do.  You can not go wrong with these, I usually purchase aussiebum swimwear but these feel better and with less cost.  Keep up the good work speedo and thanks for a GREAT product."

1,"Watermark: A Novel of the Middle Ages opens with the event of Auda's birth, her welcome to the world, and a glimpse of the superstition that she faces throughout her life. By the time Auda is grown, she has learned her father's craft and has learned to express herself clearly in her writing. Few of the people around her are literate, but Auda has fashioned a life for herself.

Between assisting in the papermaking, serving as a scribe, and hiding her albino features, Auda has learned to move around in her world. Despite the danger to her person, Auda is not one to trade freedom for safety or independence for marriage. Though with the spread of the Inquisition's power, Medieval Europe is fraught with danger for anyone who seems different - and Auda knows that she can never blend in.

When Auda obtains the job of scribe in the castle, she flourishes. Her skills and writing bring her the respect and appreciation of powerful women. But her writing and beliefs also bring danger and loss.

Watermark is a carefully crafted and fascinating work of historical fiction. It's a story of love, fear and superstition, and of the struggle to keep one's identity.

1,"This is a movie really meant to be watched in a theatre, instead I watched it on a Kindle 10"" Fire HDX.  The visuals and CGI are superb, easily the best since the now ancient Apollo 13.  Sandra Bullock & George Clooney give good performances.  Unfortunately the story & script just don't hold up under even minor scrutiny.  Space Shuttle crews trained together for a year more before a mission, but from the start, Clooney as mission commander, appears to have only just met Bullock, who plays a scientist intent of upgrading the Hubble telescope.  Later, it's made known that Clooney doesn't know even where Bullock lives.  For me, a thread of unbelievability runs throughout the movie, which could easily have been fixed had the producers hired a genuine SST astronaut as an advisor to the script."

Another thing is that the figures that come with it are larger than other duplo sets, so they will not fit in other duplo vehicles, and the train roof will not close if they are inside.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a dog with a big head or neck and wants to work on their head.

I have a 14lb lab mix and I like this harness to allow her to walk with ease. It is a bit awkward to put on, but it is sturdy enough to allow her to stretch out while walking. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has a dog with a very large head or neck.

I want to like this, however, the sound box doesn't come out making it difficult to wash. There is a small seam that can be taken out and resewn, but I wouldn't want to do that each time I need to clean it. The sound quality is pretty good for this toy, but IMO, the music/singing isn't all that easy to understand. My one year old didn't play with it for more than a minute. However, every child is different so your child may get more use out of it.  We have other fabric books that don't have a sound box that rely more sensory objects like mirrors and textures that keep him engaged longer than this book did."

1,"Just like the rest of the Fobus line, this holster is not without it's faults. Right out of the bag, it's not perfect. This one happened to be way too tight. So tight I cold barely get the gun in and had an even harder time getting it out. Me, being the cheapskate that I am, took some sandpaper and oil and got this thing up and running. So now I have a $20 holster that performs like an $80 holster for about an hours worth of sanding and polishing. This goes well with my gym shorts or any time I'm not wearing a belt. Has a nice snap lock into place and since I wear mine with loose/stretchy waistbands, I wanted my draw to be loose as well. So I made it that way. Anyone can do it. If you take off too much, just make it a range holster. Can't go wrong."

1,"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him?
I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is. I have always wanted to find a good series to read where the main character always continues on and their story develops as the world continues. I do believe I have found that story. Move over Sookie Stackhouse, Dorian Devil is the new main character to follow."

1,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought this presentation was far superior to the Ronald Coleman version. I believe that Chris Sarandon showed a much wider range of emotion and feeling in the Carton role than did Coleman. Moreover, the person in the Coleman version playing Charles Darney hardly resembled Carton, which was essential for one to believe that such an ending could occur. Further, in this version, I could actually believe that Carton had found some semblence of peace and joy in the sacrifice he had made--dying--so that the person he loved would be happy. Up to then his life was a mess--dissipation, cynicism, and recklessness. It shows how genuine love can sometimes turn a person's life completely around."

At first, they may seem stiff or even a little tight around the width of the toes, this does however subside after one or two wears. After mine broke in, they became one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own. I can wear them all day while standing in the lab and I have very little discomfort. I definitely recommend buying a pair!"

It's a little thin, but it's not too big.  The chain itself is very pretty, and the color is a very pretty blue.  I've had the chain for a few months now, and I think it's going to last a long time.  The material is very light, and the color is very vibrant.  I haven't had it in a while, but I'm sure I'll be getting it in the next couple of weeks.  The reason I bought this pair was because the sizing is off.  I didn't like the color at all, and it's not the best looking chain I've ever had.  I'm still wearing it, but I don't really like it.

1,"Funny, but I don't recall the other book leaving out this much information, but then again it was this time last year that I was reading it so maybe my memory's not so fresh. This book is good, but one thing that threw me off was the passage of time; there was no indication of it. ""2 weeks later"" ""6 months later"" these are only 3 word phrases, it wouldn't take much to add them. But one minute it was Christmas, then after a separator in the middle of the page - which usually indicates a scene change - it's spring break, then next thing you know it's Thanksgiving. One of the reasons this is a problem is right before the page separator, Adam and JJ were saying they needed to discuss something important, and then after the separator, not only has it been discussed, but the process has been put in motion and they're almost completely done with it. No build-up or anything. This happened several times, which left me scratching my head and wondering ""well, what happened in between?"" I was glad that they were able to help provide a safe place for Thad, but what happened when they went to talk to his parents? Was there no argument or backlash at all? No obstacles in their way? And how did they decide to get legal guardianship? And why was the situation with Andrea helping out Adam and JJ handled like it was no big deal, just every day happenstance? And what happened with Grace Griffin? And this may be minor, but how on Earth did Thad get a new love interest before Adam's brother, Matt? Too many questions. However, these things are not guaranteed to keep me from reading more by this author, because his books have sweet story lines with very little angst."
1,"I love every single thing about the Race to the Treasure game.  I love that the instructions are printed on the inside of the box so you can never lose the instructions.  (If you happen to lose the box all of the instructions are located on their website)  I love that all the pieces come in a reusable pouch, not those plastic bags that get thrown away.  I love that all of the materials are all recycled but all have a very high quality feel.  Most of all, I love the sheer genius that is a cooperative game.

Sure, it is important for kids to know what it feels like to win and to lose, and we still play games like Monopoly Junior where there is a clear winner but when there is too much ""I WIN I WIN"" going on in the house I pull out Peaceable Kingdom's Race to the Treasure or Hoot Owl Hoot.  Cooperative games require all players to work together as a team to win.  At first I thought there was no way my 5 year old would fall for this, he is competitive and loves to chant ""I WIN I WIN"".  Much to my surprise, he loves all of the Peaceable Kingdom games we have played.  My 5 year old son loves to help his 3 year old brother because it ultimately helps them both ""win"" the game.  And two winners is always better than one, right?

Race to the Treasure is my favorite Peaceable Kingdom game.  The goal is to create a path to pick up three keys and get to the finish before the ogre gets you.  The game requires some thinking and strategy of how you'll pick up the keys and get to the finish but most importantly, it requires the players to work together to decide which path is the best way.  It's pretty amazing to see kids working together for a common goal rather than plotting against one another for the glory."

1,"This was a warehouse deal item but if I bought another, I'd pay full price.  This had a scratch in it that I keep looking at over and over.  The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.  The top center has a small button to push  up or down to open or close it, that works good.  There is also a small hook inside to hold a tea bag.  I haven't used that feature yet but I will.  That is different and will come in handy.

02/23 update - I filled this up with coffee today and screwed the top on and the silver band split and there is about a 1/8 inch gap now in the top.  It seems to not cause any spill of the coffee yet, but we'll see.  Maybe this wasn't such a good deal after all.

03/08 - Another update.  This was a sale one day recently and I bought a silver one with a black top to take to work.  Do not buy the silver with the black top!  You cannot see where the opening is for the beverage to come out and I spill hot coffee on my cheek and clothing about 80 percent of the time.  Since I used this, I will probably have to make some scratch marks in the lid so I know when the opening is.  This will be better than a burned red face."
1,"This novel takes a look at a mystery, a Judge who disappeared without a trace in 1930, in New York.  It was a case that garnered much attention at the time.  The story is told from the viewpoints of Judge Crater's wife, mistress and household maid, all important women at his life at the time of the disappearance.

The historical accuracy seems to be there, although I was disappointed that it wasn't shared in more detail.  Prohibition, Tammany Hall, political corruption-so much going on then that could have added even more background to the story.  The characters of the women in his life are wonderful, fully drawn and seeming true to life, and sometimes bigger than life.  I was enthralled by the story, and hated to see it end."

1,"I am obsessed with mason jars. As someone that cans, I always have mason jars on hand. I use them for everything possible. I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use. They are fine for the dishwasher, I always put in the top rack personally.

I received this product for free or at a reduced cost in exchange for my honest review. This is my unbiased, honest opinion of this product."

1,"Bought this for my son's fifth birthday at a local toy store. They had a demo model in the store so I bought it full aware that the black foam edging isn't going to last based on the condition of the demo one and from reading reviews.  However, we are trying to be gentle with it. My son and I like to play bowling with it as well as air hockey. We have soft, stuffed bowling pins and just use them as the pushers and the soccer disc as the puck down our hallway. My son also enjoys spinning it around and watching the lights in motion. Even my 2 1/2 year old enjoys kicking it. It is a tad bit noisy on our tile floor but I wouldn't say it is too bothersome."
1,"Very solid and durable cable, which allowed me to easily run my surround sound speakers.

We were using bare cable before, which constantly wriggled around and caught feet and broke away from the speaker. With this, and a Wiremold kit, everything is solid, mostly invisible, and best yet AWAY FROM THE KIDS AND THEIR WIRE-KILLING WAYS!

Be aware that I wouldn't recommend running more than 100W peak over this cable, due to the 18AWG thickness. If your receiver peaks higher than 150W, for safety sake use 14AWG or lower, as thickness increases as the number drops."

He is so enchanted with the machine and so proud of himself for buying it, that he put the machine in the center of his Etruscan marble-top kitchen table.  He and I start each business day in his kitchen having a cup of coffee.  Maybe my taste palette is dead from years of Mr. C. coffee, but coffee from this new machine tastes EXACTLY like the old stuff."

1,"This was a really cute movie probably aimed at teens.  It was not meant to be high art, so I'm rating it for delivering a good job for what it was intended to be:  a cute and well written story about 3 nice and likeable Texas girls, mostly set in wonderful, romantic European settings, and just a lot of fun overall.  All three actresses were quite good and this was a nice afternoon escape film. It was nice to see a teen film that was pretty positive and wholesome for a change, not too old for its intended audience. I saw this in a theater mostly full of mid to late teen girls, and they all seemed to be enjoying it a lot."
1,Easy installation.  Works so far.  Time will tell.
0,"I have two (2) of these. The first one is a full size USB 2.0 hub. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, but if you don't mind having to go through a couple of steps to get it on, it's very compact. If you have a large laptop, it's also compact. I'm not sure if it would fit in a pocket, but I can't imagine not having to go through that. I like that the usb port on the front is a little wider than the back. I've never had any issues with the hub.

The other hub is a dual-core processor, but it's not that big. It's fairly small for my purposes. I don't know if it would fit in a pocket, but it's a good size. I have a 15"" laptop with a 15"" screen and this hub is small enough to fit in a pocket. I haven't used it yet, but I'm going to try. The other is a mini USB 2.0 hub.

1,"I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp."

1,"My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy!
I think they work very well for the price, and for being just a standard filter cartridge. They're nothing fancy, but I'm satisfied with how they work. I would, and have, recommended this product to friends."
0,"A crew of officers who are caught in the middle of a cold war war, must make the difficult decision to enlist the help of a former Nazi officer, a former Marine who is sent to the frontlines in the wake of a surprise attack.

1,"These Blaze trucks are great. They're solid and more durable unlike a lot of the other cheap stuff that's out there today.

We now have all of our kids' favorite characters (Blaze, Stripes, Zeg, and Pickle) from a mix of purchasing online and at local retailers. I'm surprised and a little upset that a lot of sellers have marked these up so much, I found it at my local retailer for about 5-6 bucks.

We'll probably round out our collection with a few more, but the ones we have are already being heavily played with."
1,"Nice flip up BUIS - push the button and the POP right up - kinda cool.  They sit nice and snug on picatinny rail but a little wide bodied on the base.  The rear sight has notched center line that matches up with eye hole - so that was good for centering the sight sight and I was able to adjust sight in quickly.  You might want to snug down the screws with some lock tight as that the rear sight came loose after several rounds and these screws require a allen wrench, so bring one along just in case.

My main sight is a fiber optics and these are just backups and I am pleased with them for the money - not a bad deal."

Another home run by Ms. Kennedy. This third book is just as good as the first two. Kyler was so perfect for Ella. The way he introduced her vanilla self to BDSM was so easy. I loved seeing all the old crew. Then the test they made for Porter...she's gonna give him a run for his money. Oh and that last chapter is some serious panty melting stuff.

The characters are well developed. This is a very good book. I recommend it to anyone who is new to the world of fantasy. I've read all of Stephen King's books and I love them all. However, this one is very different. The story is about a couple who were estranged from their loved ones for years, but just couldn't get enough of each other. This book was a great read. It was a quick read and I enjoyed it immensely. The author does an excellent job of explaining the relationship between Stephen and Rose. Both are very strong people with a strong bond and love. The story is about the situation Stephen and Rose were in when they were separated. There was a lot of backstory that I didn't know about at all, but I loved it."

1,"These cups are huge and beautiful.  Unfortunately when I got my package, there was an ominous rattling in the box.  There is very little packing between the cups and apparently an impact had shattered one completely, shattered one's handle beyond repair and snapped another handle off which was able to be reattached with just a little gap missing. Only the blue cup survived.

Sadly, I really love the cup that survived, so I miss the ones that didn't make it.  The mugs are nice and big, perfect for serving desserts, soups or cereals out of.  It doesn't seem to be the highest quality ceramic mug, but it is decent.  It seems homey and casual enough to use everyday, and survives the dishwasher fine.

I'm sure Amazon would replace any mugs destroyed in transit, but I with a little more care in packaging had been used to ensure that they would arrive intact.  Otherwise, they are beautiful."

1,"Here's a wonderful book for any fan of Ursula Le Guin. It begins with a foreword by the author in which she outlines each of the stories, most of which take place on worlds of her well-known Ekumen, her &#147;Hainish Universe.&#148;. However alien the cultures may be, however strange their societal structures and customs, Ms. Le Guin uses each tale to underscore what truly unites us and makes us human. These stories comprise the first two-thirds of the book.
As much as I relish Le Guin&#146;s Hainish stories, it is the novelette &#147;Paradises Lost,&#148; comprising the final third of the book, that is most rewarding. It&#146;s a change of pace for the author, involving not the worlds of the Ekumen, but rather a generation spacecraft on a 201-year voyage from Earth to a &#147;New Earth&#148; orbiting some unnamed neighboring star. Most of the narrative involves characters who have lived their entire lives in this self-contained bubble of metal and air. They know nothing of Earth save what they have experienced via films and &#147;virtual reality&#148; programs. The simple concept of &#147;sky&#148; is completely unfathomable to them. They have their own rituals and customs with which they structure their lives until it becomes necessary to debark on the surface of a new world. Ultimately, for some hese colonists who have become comfortable in their self-contained universe, the notions of OUTSIDE and NEW WORLD begin to seem rather intimidating and even evil. How will they cope when the spacecraft arrives at its destination? Ms. Le Guin deftly explores this culture and its destiny, and the ending quite literally brought tears to my eyes. Throughout &#147;The Birthday of the World,&#148; we realize how much we have in common as human beings, no matter whether we are on Gethen, in a spaceship, on Earth, or anywhere in the universe, that we have our loves, our hopes, and our fears, and that EVERY DAY is the birthday of the world."

1,"This is a reasonably entertaining book, though one needs to gloss over the often transparent plot and pretty one-dimensional characters.  The story line (prison world, alien technology with untapped potential, corrupt political system, rogue army general, a hero not fully aware of what he is, etc.) is not particularly original, but it hangs together and has no glaring holes even if how some of those holes are filled is at times not particularly credible or even meaningful."

1,"I bought these as a gift for my 20 year old son.  He is notoriously hard to buy shoes for.  Not only is he incredibly picky but he has wide feet and can not stand a tight fitting shoe  He would wear nothing but Sanuk's if he could but with snow on the ground, that is not very practical.

I purchased him both the Timberland Chestnut Ridge and these FRYE Dakota boots at the same time.  He tried both out around the house and decided to keep the FRYE.  The Timberlands were too narrow and the leather not nearly as supple as the FRYE, making the fit very uncomfortable.  He also thought the FRYE boot was just better looking overall.

After he wore the FRYE Dakota boot several times, he gave me the following feedback --

These are really great looking boots.  They offer excellent support/comfort around the ankles.  They are stiff but at the same time the leather is semi supple and giving, so walking in them feels great. I broke them in by strolling around NYC all day -- no blisters, chaffing or sore feet.  They have room in the toe box for my wide feet but not so much that they feel loose.  They sort of hug my foot but because the leather gives a bit, it's not an uncomfortable feeling at all.  Nice bonus -- they also add an inch or so to my height but hide it very well.

Thank goodness I finally found a boot he likes.  Hopefully FRYE lives up to its reputation for making long lasting boots!"

1,"When it comes to wine I tend to over indulge and before I know it, I blow my diet.  What a simple and great idea to mark 4, 6 and 8 ounce servings on these wine glasses or any type of beverage such as juice, milk or soda.  The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.  This comes in a package of 2 wine glasses and they are dishwasher safe.  I really like this product and would recommend this to all my friends and family who are tracking their alcohol intake."

1,I finally found jeans that fit the way I like. They are soft and comfortable with just the right amount of room where it counts. It's the reason I bought six pair in different colors.

There were a lot more colors than the six I bought.

It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a basement. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the ground. It is a good hammock for the price! You can also put it in the back of a truck. It is very sturdy. It has a nice handle that makes it very comfortable. It is also a very light weight. We used it in our hammock, but it was a little difficult to get it to get into the ground.

We did not expect to be able to set it up with the hammock on it. However, the hammock is very light and easy to set up. We have not had a problem with the hammock getting stuck on something. We also have had to take it out of the hammock and put it in the back of a truck. The hammock is very easy to set up and it is very easy to adjust to your comfort level.

1,"I've used gel cases in the past for tablets and phones but I wanted to try this style with the flap/stand and magnetic lock. Reasonable price made it worth the try. I've been pleasantly surprised by the usefulness. If I need another angle, I can use things like pillows that can be sandwiched between the flipped back cover and the iPad. Cover stays on well; I can carry it like a book. No flopping around at all. We shall see how it goes long term but for the price it is well worth it.
Only downside I've found is that two horizontal lines form on the glass after removing the cover if it's been closed for a while. Can't notice any issues when using the iPad, but just wanted to mention that minor drawback to an otherwise great value item."

1,"Too many small book for the price, Just combine into one. Enjoyed the book. Tired of buying so many pieces of the story. Can't give it a 5 Star for those reasons."
1,"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around."
1,"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light."
1,"I'd give this 5 stars, but the first one had a defective switch and had to be returned (at least Amazon has a painless return process).  When it works, this is a great flashlight/work light.  Extremely bright.  Strong magnets for attaching to ferrous surfaces.  The bottle opener is weird, but hey WTF.

Would have paid another dollar for a switch that selects either or both lights separately from the power switch.  With this unit, you cycle through the four possible combinations (top light, side light, both, off)."

Apparently this rack is only made for Toyota's, with their track being set close to the top of the bedrail. So if you are considering this rack and own a Nissan, first decide if drilling two holes in your bed is acceptable.

I'm not sure I want two permanent holes in my truck to worry about rusting. Plus, not all bikes will fit the same way, but the holes will be there regardless. So I will most likely return this rack.

I will say however, the parts are all well designed and sturdy, and I assume that this would be a nice rack, when it fits."

It did help her neck, but she felt a little claustrophobic with it on so she went back to wadding up a pillow.  I rated it a 3 because it did work, when used.  My wife just didn't like it enough to keep using it."

All skills are tested in this book. We start to get more information about who Kate really is, and what makes her so powerful. The chemistry between Curran and Kate is getting unbearable, for them and me! But she's not some dimwitted woman who falls for just anyone because he's cute (a.k.a. Rachel Morgan).

This one has all the power I need and the battery (so far) hasn't been a problem.  So much so, I bought 2 more on a clearance sale.  As someone else said, I don't understand the negative comments.  The blower is at the bottom but so far I haven't had any problem with picking up dust and even feathers which get randomly get blown into my house.  The detachable cone is simple to undo and empty however on the down side, the filter is not that easy to clean.  Dust, especially if you try washing it, gets stuck between the crevices.

Even though the storyline sounds like it could contain a lot of brutal scenes it was really pretty tame, like PG rated.

1,"I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products."

1,"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story. I would love to see someone else's spin on it."

1,"I am not a movie reviewer.  You may like it and you may not.  Once I caught on to the plot, I enjoyed it.  Part of the plot has to do with Celtic (pagan) rituals vs Christianity.  This may bother the very devout Christians as it did the lead character.  On the other hand, this movie is very well thought of in England and according to one movie group, is considered the 6th best movie made in England.  It comes close to being as popular as Rocky Horror Picture Show and I can imagine people lining up at midnight to see this movie and well prepared to sing along.  After all, it is a musical horror movie with no blood.  Do you want to hear a young Christopher Lee sing?"

The hairballs are much less, not gone, but at least she's not producing a major one every other day (it's now about one hairball every 3 weeks).  She's put on some much needed weight, too, and eats better.

I consider this a real success.  Also, she loves the gel Laxatone (catnip flavor), so every third day or so I give her one dose of that in addition to the chews."

1,"I was looking forward to receiving this robe. I appeared to be what I was looking for (except color). Unfortunately it won't do. The robe tie is woefully too short. It is so small that it just makes one tie and comes undone easily (!), can't have that now, can we? After two washings, it is starting the unraveling at the sleeves. Not much, but it does make me think this will be ratty looking in a year or so. It is lightweight which is nice for Arizona but not the softest material I've experienced. I have just ordered a bathrobe from another company and with hope, it will be what I was looking for.

One year later update:

For the price, this is a poor product. This is a $15 bathrobe that is good for a year of daily, yet light use. The seams are just giving away. There are numerous fabric strands all over the robe. It never was very soft. If I had paid $15, I would've just figured I got what I paid for. Not so with this robe at $40. I guess I'm looking for another robe one year later..."

She wears a loose fitted dress which exemplifies her hippie boho chic style. On her feet are detailed boots which have little fangs on them.

1,"I wanted this automatic toothbrush dispenser for my son. He is 6  with high functioning Autism. Im trying to teach him to be more independent. He knows how to brush his teeth, but has a hard time getting the cap off the tooth paste and squeezing it to get the paste out. When I saw this on Amazon, I knew I had to get it. Plus, he loves animals and the tiger is so cute.

Here are my only CONS:

-It took FOREVER to arrive in the mail.
-The word automatic is a little misleading. When I think automatic, I think you put your brush in and the past automatically comes out. With this you actually put your brush in and push on something and then the toothpaste comes out. It has worked out OK, but I wanted to point that out to potential buyers.
-Directions were a little tricky, as it was in Chinese, but I did find some small print English in there (just took me a while to locate it)

The positives:

-My son can now independently get the toothpaste on his brush and brush his teeth without my assistance.
-The suction cup has help up just fine! It is on our mirror right above the faucet.
-So far, it has been compatible with all toothpastes Ive bought.

All in all, this is cute and decent for the price!

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my genuine review."

The problem with this costume was with the cap:  it was misshapen and hard to keep on his head.  I tried to contact the company to get a replacement for the cap but had no luck.  I would have had to return to Amazon.  I bought too close to Halloween and the rest of the costume was so cute, we just kept it and he still looked great."

1,"My kitty got a Urinary Tract Infection, and I was really, really worried this could be an ongoing issue, so I purchased this supplement to add to my existing dietary supplement routine. When I put the full amount (1/4 teaspoon) in her food, she turned her little nose up at it and refused to touch it. She was supposed to get the full dose twice a day for two to three weeks before going down to a maintenance dose of 1/4 teaspoon once or twice a week. So, I did the math, and the next day put 1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) in her food, and after a couple of suspicious sniffs, she ate her food without complaint. This equals out to two full doses (1/2 of a teaspoon) every eight days, which is right around the maintenance level. She (and her two brothers) have managed to eat this without issue for several weeks now. She's had a few issues, where I thought perhaps the UTI was recurring, but they were only minor blips, and otherwise, she's been just fine, so I'm very pleased. When used a a preventative, at the maintenance dose, this stuff seems to do the trick! I plan to keep them all on this and am hoping for no further issues."

I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that it's made of a durable, tough material that doesn't crack or tear. The smaller size does, however, feel a bit small for a German Shepherd, and the larger size doesn't hold a lot of weight. It's also made of some other sort of plastic, so I don't know why the material feels like it's made of a plastic. I have to give it a 5 for the price. I wouldn't go wrong with this one.

1,"Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience. However, there seems to be no benefit to the reformulation of Indoor Light, but it has caused problems for many cat owners, including myself.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision."

1,I bought this book not only because Anne Rice wrote it but because it was being compared to 50 Shades of Gray. It sounded like it was full of sexual scenes when in reality there weren't very many. So that was a little disapointing. Then there was quite a few boy on boy mentionings so that also turned me off a little as well. In addition I thought that she would go into deep detail about S&M...more scenes that kinda thing. I do have to say that the detail in this book was very adequate. She explained every detail as if to make you feel that you were really there. Also the underlying love story was kinda sweet in a twisted way:) All in all this was a good book...not a waste of time...but different than what I'm used to reading.

1,"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless."

1,"My son actually wore out his videotape copies of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase, Zombie Island, and Witch's Ghost. That's how much of a Scooby fan he is and has been since he was first introduced (he's 10 now).

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion. It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough. A bonus episode from the TV series is included which my son enjoyed as well.

In the end we'll collect this one just like the others. We have a whole shelf of Scooby movies and shows. Since this one has already been watched a couple times it's definitely going up on that keeper shelf!"
1,Nice sequel to the Holloweentown series.  Just wish all the original cast were there but this was still a good video.
0,"This is, quite simply, a better set of grips than the standard grip.

The only downside is that the grip seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The grip is made of a material that is not stiff enough to allow it to hold a lot of weight. The grip is a bit too small to be comfortable, but the grip is not stiff enough to be comfortable. I would not recommend this grip to anyone who is considering purchasing this grip.

Overall, this grip is a solid quality product, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great grip. I am happy with my purchase.I love the way this holster fits.  The grip is comfortable and the gun is easy to conceal.  I can tell that I am getting a lot of use out of this holster.  I have no complaints about this holster.

I received this holster at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

The holster is made of a solid plastic that can be used in any way for any purpose.  The gun is well constructed, and the holster is strong and compact.  I would not recommend this holster to anyone.

I have used this holster for a few months now, and I am pleased with the quality.  The holster is very comfortable and comfortable, and the holster fits my M&P 45 well."

1,"This movie reminded me of several episodes I saw on Law and Order and Special Victims regarding children sociopaths. It wasn't difficult to see that Kevin had a serious behavioural problem early on, as a viewer it was quite clear.  However, as a parent it would be very difficult to admit your child had little or no conscience  at all and was capable of committing such heinous acts.  My heart went out to Tilda Swinton for trying to deal with a child she realized had serious problems, with no one to turn to for help or guidance, it was quite hopeless.  I got the feeling from the start of her pregnancy and after the birth she never seemed happy about motherhood.  The question presents itself. Are the mother's feelings transferred to the child during pregnancy?  I recommend this movie to those who like realistic but difficult subject matter."

1,"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress.
I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

For reference, I am 5'3, 140lbs, 36D-29-39.  Hope this helps someone."
1,"Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash."

1,"Mostly, this well-produced film is distinguished by a muted, naturalistic tone and good acting backing a logical script. But there's neither drama or action to recommend. It's just a unique
view of a rather mundane aspect of a samurai's domestic life. In another context, it might be
a soap-opera rendition of Samurai family life, traumas and all."
1,"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now for a few weeks and feel more awake in AM with that extra light boost."

1,"I had my doubts about this product but when I started using it I realized there are a lot of possibilities to use this. It's stainless steel so it will match any kitchen decor. It's very attractive so it can be displayed on the table or put in the cabinet with the spices. It's pretty lean so it won't take up much space but it held more oil than I expected.
I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.

1,"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.
Note: I had misplaced the instruction notice, and could not read the one posted on their website. I contacted Hoover, a very nice man answered and very courteously sent me a new one."

I bought another size for a different dog and he's a 5 pounder.  This size fits him perfect and I like it.  I wish it had been a little longer for him but he doesn't like it.  It was too big for him to chew on it and it was too big for him to chew on the handle.  I would have given it 5 stars but it didn't fit him well.

1,"Overall - 2.5 stars
You can have the werewolf and eat the cheesecake too. This is a BBW paranormal romance with all the usual elements.

Fantasy World - 2 stars
The world is a bit ragged around the edges, and you'll definitely need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the story.

Tingle - 3 stars
A hot, naked man shows up on the doorstep, and wants to get busy. What's not to like? The sheik scene is more odd than hot though.

Characters - 3 stars
Full of hot, Alpha werewolf stereotypes. Carole's self-esteem issues become tiresome, and I desperately wanted her to get a clue.

Story - 2 stars
The plot is a well worn path. Nothing new, but it's still fun to take a stroll down it.

Summary
When Carol Anne goes to claim a surprise inheritance from her dead Uncle, she doesn't know it includes a sexy man showing up on her doorstep to provide erotic delights. She's trying to recover from her divorce, and plans to live alone in the country. Unfortunately, Carol Anne doesn't know she's actually close to a hidden werewolf town, and is smack in the middle of a fight between werewolves and panthers.

My Wolf King by Rose Wynters is a fairly standard paranormal romance with familiar elements. It's not going to rock your world, but is more like snuggling into your favorite sweats with a side of cocoa and cookies. You get to visit with hot men who know their mates at once, and a real sized woman who is valued for being more than a twig."

My kids young and old (3-11 years) enjoy making mama crabby....because mama is sometimes crabby right?  Anywho, this potato is a lot of fun.  My kids really like mixing all the different pieces and creating some rather interesting Potato peeps. The quality of the pieces and potato body are very good. Some of her pieces are a bit hard to push in but I suspect that they will loosen up with continued play.  We have not attempted to store her pieces in her ahem....behind.  No idea if they all fit.

The questions are the same over and over again - which is only logical (it uses deductive reasoning), it's voice gets annoying and it sometimes doesn't understand your response (how many times do you need to repeat the word ""no""?).

1,"I liked it. I didn't love it.

After finishing this book, I tried to determine exactly what I didn't love about it. It took me a moment to put my finger on it. There was an entertaining main character, lots of action, some cool magic, and even a bit of romance. I think the problem was that I didn't connect with the main character.

Harry was so...I don't know. And that's the point. The book is written in Harry's first-person point-of-view, and Harry repeatedly reminds the reader that he is a skilled wizard. He also reminds the reader, on a number of occasions, that those who are privileged to see into his soul are generally shocked or terrified at what they see. Through Harry's accomplishments, I saw that Harry is indeed a skilled wizard. But I never saw what was inside his soul. I want to know about his dark past. I want to know Harry.

On a couple of occasions in the book, Harry claims to struggle with his choices. He wants to do the right thing, but the power of his magic draws him toward darker things. I know about these struggles because Harry told me so explicitly. Never once I did I actually see him make so much as a questionable decision. He did the right thing; he fought for good. So all the rambling in his head about his dark past and about temptation was lost on me. I saw no inner turmoil. I saw only a good guy skilled in magic attempting to fight a powerful, power-hungry evil guy.

Without a backstory, this is a typical good versus evil book. So it didn't blow me away. I will read the second book in this series though, and I hope to see Harry making some tough decisions that show me the darkness he claims is inside him."

1,"This is well made and comfortable. The color is less bright than in the photo, but only slightly and I like the color very much. It's flattering with my silver hair. I bought a large instead of medium because I know that Columbia coats run small on me. It fit perfectly. The fabric is lighter than I expected because all of my other fleece jackets are thicker. However, for Southern California, this works very well as a top layer when it's a little cooler in the morning. For example, when I want to walk in the early morning and it's a bit too chilly for just a top, this works well. It goes with all my work out clothes and also looks good with jeans, shorts, and T-shirt dresses. I got a great deal on this color, and I'm glad I got it instead of the charcoal color I had been looking for."

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a bit small and the plastic part on the handle is a bit tight. It is not a problem for me. If I had to pick one, I would say it is a good choice.

I had to return it due to the fact that it is very heavy. I tried to return it to Amazon but they did not respond to my emails. I have yet to find a return option.

1,"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series."

From The Book: A Novel by Diana Adams

Author: Diana Adams

Publisher: T&E

I enjoyed this book.  It was a very interesting story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over 50 years.  As they are getting older and having to deal with the past, they are facing a new life together.  They are both young women who are very interested in each other.  They are both going through a difficult time, but they are also going through a very difficult time.  They are both trying to make it through the time together.  The story was very well written and the characters were well developed.  I think the main reason I give it 5 stars was because it was a very good story.  I think the book is very well written and the story line is very interesting.  I think I would recommend it to anyone.  I am not sure if this is the best or the worst book"

1,"This is the epic story of one woman's journey to find knowledge and understanding about her own life but also for the world we live in. The book is beautifully written with dozens of unique characters that she meets during the eighty plus years of her life. The book actually starts with her dad as a young boy as he moves from humble origins in England to become one of the richest men in America by utilizing his knowledge of Botany to make profits. But, the book is much more than this. This book covers a full range of human emotions from humor to intense sorrow  - but what ties this book together is the heroine's quest for knowledge and understanding. I recommend this book in particular to people who have an innate sense of curiosity about the wondrous world we live in."

0,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

This is a great book. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story with a great storyline. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun and sexy read.

1,"Oh, M. Night...I've given you many chances. I loved Sixth Sense, Signs, Unbreakable, and the Village was decent. But this movie makes Lady in the Water look like a masterpiece. It was a glorified ""B"" movie at best, and I think I'm being generous. I could buy the storyline had another director taken on the task of making this film and developing the script to make it realistic. In contrast, it was like watching a train wreck...the dialogue was elementary and made the acting subpar and laughable. The story felt amateur and therefore comedic rather than scary. I'm suspecting that M. Night just gave up and needed to cash in to pay off some debts. Never again...never again..."
0,"I have say I was a little disappointed with the quality of the product, but I am pretty confident that it will last a long time.  The ring itself is pretty sturdy, and the color is pretty striking.  The size is a little small for me, but it's not a problem.  I have a large chest, which is a little on the small side, but it fits my heart better than I would like.  The color scheme is a little more subdued, but it is still pretty good.  The sleeve is really nice, and it fits great.  The material is pretty nice, and the material is pretty soft.  The only thing I did not like is the color.  I really don't like the color, and I don't think it will be a big deal for me.  I really don't like the design of the company, and I think it is a little weird that I didn't get this.  I will probably buy a different color, but I don't really care about it.  I really don't care that much about the color, so I guess I will just buy the colors.This is the only one I have that will fit my Glock 22 perfectly.  The only negative is that it's a little too large.  If you're going to carry this, you'll need to get a larger size.  It's a little bulky for my Glock 22.

I spent many happy hours with Dalziel and Pascoe, Joe Sixsmith and numerous other characters. And I saved this last stand-alone novel for three years. It was so worth it. He is as usual brilliantly smart, witty, and desperately in love with English language. Alas, there is nobody out there with such a turn of phrase, with an uncanny ability to make words dance and twirl like a dozen of dervishes. So, it is over. Farewell Reg, you are sorely missed. Angels with you."

We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.  Neither ""con"" affects the overall performance."

1,"I bought this for my daughter at a local dollar store(don't pay more than 10 for it in 2011, they've got them again this year) last year. Due to lack of batteries(3 Ds- we kept using them in our son's crib soother) and me kind of forgetting that it was up in the cupboard, we didn't use it for months and months. But we got it out the other night and she had an absolute blast with it. Yes, the pegs don't stick very well due to the truncated ends, if they'd put another quarter inch on the tapered part, they'd be fine. It uses 6 3/4 inch square pieces of paper- we're going to see if we can find some heavy origami paper to use with it because the refills are expensive.

Keep in mind that there is no off switch, it's timed and turns itself off every few minutes, it's easily turned back on by pushing the button located just above the peg storage.

Even with it's faults- it's all plastic, pegs don't stick, I still think it's a good product, just needs some tweaking. Some people say they have problems with the peg holder, which is semi circular tube shaped, you rotate it to get the opening out, but we haven't had any. I taught my daughter(who will be five in 2 months) that it's gotta be flat in order to open the pegs, and she can do it herself, as well as close it up.

In fact, if you overlook the cost of refills or having to cut construction paper to fit, it's an excellent product for the price I paid. It lets her be creative and not messy, and helps her patience level lol."

They dim to 10%, while the more expensive GE bulb barely dims to 40%. I love it when a product exceeds my expectations and seeing the word dimmable on the box was a wonderful surprise. For some reason the lifetime is rated as 22.8 years at 3 hours a day. That comes to a total of 2.85 years or about 25000 hours. At the price that's still a bargain."

Opened multiple tabs at once - no issues.  Netflix is WAY faster than my old computer too.  I have not tried word processing, etc, but I'm sure it will be fine.  Google apps are easy to browse/find.  I would recommend this to anyone, especially as it is much cheaper than any other option.
Update: after about a week, I'm still very pleased with this Chromebook.  As some reviewers have said, the display is not that great for watching Netflix (it still streams faster than my previous laptop), but is perfect for web browsing etc. Also, I use a Nike running (GPS) watch that I tried to connect to the Chromebook, but found out there is no app for it :>(
But for me, the price, speed, (and hopefully) longevity is worth it."

This was my major problem with the book - although I enjoyed reading it, I had to keep going back to keep track of the plot. So many confessions and explanations!

I loved Angelica's sense of humor and personality, especially her willingness to sacrifice for someone she loves.  I was pleased with their HEA (even if the epilogue was a tease).

1,"I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

They sound great.

The material is not see through so it will be fine if you don't have a lot of pockets. The bottom is a bit snug but I can wear it on my shoulder and I'm sure it will stretch. The top is a bit too small but I like that it's not too tight. I'm sure it will be fine. I've only worn it twice so I don't know how it will hold up. I haven't worn it at all yet but I'm sure it'll be fine.I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and ordered a medium for my 5'8"", 195lbs, the size I normally wear was too big. I've ordered a medium in a few other brands and have had no luck finding a fit. I think I might order a small. The sizing on the other brands is way off.

This frame is then decorated with the included string as well as little beads and gems that come in the kit. It's a fun kit but it's the all that difficult or involved. An eight year old could easily complete the project without assistance and older girls, over twelve or so, will likely become bored with it or complete the project very quickly. What I like most about the kit is that it doesn't involve glue or anything messy. It's something that can be completed on a car trip."

She also gives enough of history, so the reader understands the broader context, in this case, as in many of her books, WWII. Helen, I think, wants the reader to understand all the ramifications for choices for good or evil, and that true evil really does exist. Her heroes, thankfully, are always the good guys, which makes for an entertaining, as well as educational, read."

1,"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup."

1,"I didn't think it possible but I believe this book was better than the last one. It needs a better editor but the story is really good. It centers on the Weathers family and JD (Justice) in particular. He has 2 teenaged boys, twins, Briggs and Dawson. He's a widower and carries a lot of guilt and anger. When his wife died he was having a fling with a woman who really got to him. Then he found out that his wife took her life, not because of him but because of her own nature. That's a whole other ball of wax. Anyway his father agrees to be interviewed by the star of a show that showcases western lifestyles, because the original story was about his family as a kid and what had become of them. That led to Jason, JD's father.well turns out that the woman doing the interviews is the woman he had that weekend with, that he can't seem to forget. Needless to say the story gets ever so much more interesting when she hits town. OMG, this book has it all- action, kidnapping, romance, an angel and so much more. I couldn't stop reading it. Just had to get to the end! Too good! Hard to believe but it's true.it helps to read the first book but it can be read as a standalone book."
1,"Hey! you know that Chance scouted out the location of the canyon when he was haveing her plane connections delayed and rerouted.
I loved the way L. Howard kept the character of Chance true to form from one story to the next.
Also if John is old enough to have a girlfriend he is old enough to get caught up in some machinations that needs Zane and Chance to rescue him and set him on the path of his two uncles'- besides Zane needs to produce another daughter and Chance one to put them into a hilarious competition [aided and abetted by their wives]
there are still enough up close stories to be told with Mary and Wolf still in the background -- and lets go back in time to Michael's and Josh's stories.
I, along with so many others, agree that this has been the best family series ever written - with all of the ladies well matched with the Mackenzie men - this is a family that can't stand still - these are classics -
With Sunny willing to put her life on the line for Chance, she does a great job of breaking down his reserve and teaching him to love.  Love only comes from giving.
I do love a woman who is willing to take care of her own self-preservation [grin] and dragging a man into realizing her worth.
L. Howard has spoiled us with her Mackenzie Men -- Don't stop now!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- DEFINITELY A KEEPER FOR ANY LIBRARY!"

1,"I've used OtterBox before for my phones and have had nothing but great things to say about them so I was interested to see what they do with an iPad case.

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you."

I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good. I would recommend this holster for anyone looking for a good quality holster. I have a pair of these for my husband. They are pretty tight, but not too tight.

0,Very interesting book. I recommend it highly. I've read all of her books and just can't get enough of her stories. This is the first of the three I've read by this author and she has a way of putting it down. I recommend it highly. I love a book that starts with the most beautiful idea and then lets you think about how you could accomplish it. This book is a must read for any creative mind. I would recommend it to anyone who is into music. I enjoyed this book. It was a little confusing at times but it was well written. I really enjoyed the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how the two different families formed. I loved how the family was represented and how it was connected. I enjoyed the history of the family and how it was different. I liked how the author used the example of a priest from a different family to explain the family. I enjoyed the stories and the characters and the story. I liked the historical background of the family and how it was connected. It was a great read. I was very impressed with this book. It was very different from the other books I have read about the history of the old West and the American Revolution. I thought the characters were interesting and well-drawn.

1,"The first set of torches I received were not working.  I had to contact amazon customer service and they were excellent in guiding me on how to return it.  I received a set of new torches shortly and only two worked after a few months.  I thought maybe I needed new rechargeable batteries for the two that didn't work so I took the batteries out of the good ones and put them in the ones that didn't work-it still didn't work.

The reason I bought these tiki lights were because they looked really nice but my purchase experience was not too pleasant.  When the lights failed shortly after my purchase I thought that was that and therefore the one star review, however, the seller reached out to me to replace them.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this company stood behind their product.  I just received a new set today that they sent me just in time to enjoy the ambience in my backyard for the Fourth of July.  Although I gave the product a one star rating I give this company a 5 star rating for their excellent customer service."

My last pair lasted over a year with the only substantial wear being the inner sole.  The only reason I needed to order a new pair is because my dog got ahold of my old pair and decided they made a better toy for him than shoes for me......otherwise I'm sure they would have made it at least a few more months."
1,I already have Dewalt 20V tools and needed to add a drill.  The chuck on this is very smooth and nice for changing bits.  Tightens down easily with out tearing up your hand.  Compact head fits into many tight areas.  Fairly light weight for a drill.  Power has been very good for drilling metal and wood so far.  It does come with a belt clip but DOES NOT come with a spare bit holder on the other side of the tool.  Some Dewalt tools do come with this and some do not.  This one does not.  The battery life has been excellent so far.  Since I am just a home user I can't really speak to if the brushless is really increasing my run time.  I can say it is lasting a lot longer than my Craftsman 19.2V I replaced (Both had about the same amp hour Li-Ion battery capacity).  When they say bare tool they mean bare tool this came in a clear plastic bag.  I will update this rating if my feelings change or I encounter any failures but so far so good.

1,As it comes it is not much use.  Like others I replaced the sand paper like covering with carpet with double faced tape.  Another negative is that if you are using this in your driveway the thing will slip right off the car unless you are supporting it.  There are no rubber feet or anything to help it grab the surface.  With my 80 pound lab it is very difficult to guide him while holding the ramp in place with my foot. He is finally getting used to it but it has slipped out from under him twice causing him to be very wary of it.  Not sure how to remedy that.  But when it works it is very helpful. I cannot lift my 10 year old boy into the car and as he ages he (WE) will need it more and more.

I can't wait to read the next one!I received a free copy of this book from the author for my honest review.

This book was very interesting to me. It is the first book I've read by this author, and I was very interested in it. It is definitely a different take on the characters of the first book. I was very curious about this book, and it has it all. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters.

The story is well-written, and the characters are well-developed. I enjoyed the story a lot. I thought the author did a good job of setting the mood of the characters and the story.

1,"Well, I bought the Benjamin 392 for plinking away at tin cans and taking the occasional jack rabbit that might invade my garden, and I have to say that I am very impressed with this rifle so far. It's fairly quiet, and as a contractor, I have nail guns that are louder than my 392, so shooting in the back yard is not a problem. At only 4 pumps, Crosman ""destroyer"" pellets will go right through a unopened soda can at 5 yards, and Crosman hollow points, and pointed pellets are are also among my favorites. My only accessories were to keep it simple- I added a Benjamin sling, and had to install the swivels myself, but that was an easy task. I also added the Benjamin intermount in case I want to add a scope later, and that was it. The rifle is very accurate with its iron sights (for my use anyway), and it required very little break time. About 10 shots, and I had it sighted in, and putting pellets through the same hole after about 15 rounds...

Very pleased with the 392's appearance and perfromace. Its metal, and beautiful wood construction and its a proven design that has been around for decades. Its fairly easy to handle and a joy to shoot. I would totally recommend the 392 to anyone who just wants a good all-around .22 air rifle. I'd personally rate the rifle a 10 out of 10 stars for its design and reliability!

1,"It isn't easy for Zac, coming of age in a small Missouri town in the 1960s. People think hes slow. Thats not true, but he would rather they thought that than know the truth. While the other boys are discovering the charms of the opposite sex, Zac realizes he has it bad for a slightly older neighbor boy, Rory. Zac escapes into his own world of drawings and fantasies.

Art of the Heart is a bittersweet coming of age story. In just a few pages, the author captures the pathos of growing up in a small town knowing you're different than everyone else, and dealing with that first crush which is made tougher by being unrequited.

Dont be fooled by the subject or plot into thinking this is some sappy Young Adult (YA) story. Art of the Heart is a story mature adults will probably relate to more than teens or twenty-somethings. The effects of first love can only really be appreciated from some distance. Theres a maturity to the story that belies the plot line, which is not to say the characters are unbelievable. In fact, they seem quite real. Its just that they are drawn from a perspective one doesnt often see in stories about young people."

1,Got this for Christmas last year. Had 2 6.5s and a bridged 12 hooked up. Ran 0 gauge from battery and ground and 12g to speakers. Worked well for about 6 months. Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled. For the price it sounded as expected and for the time it did work it worked ok. I did expect it to last longer than it did.

1,"Back and better than ever!!! I had both Shrinky Dinks and TMNT Toys as a kid and it's so cool that everything is back for the new generation. What's even better now is that the plastic is pre-cut so there's no sharp plastic edges like before. It's little things like that which make a big difference. So does the play set. Wow! It's a 3d backdrop to play with the creations on. There's all the turtles and villains too.

The kit includes the pencils and everything needed to color, create, and play. You just need your own oven and baking sheet. Adult supervision is needed on this one but they can color on their own. It's more fun than coloring in coloring books... so much fun to create you'll want to do it with the kids, especially if you are sentimental for Shrinky Dinks of the 70's-80's.

If you're not familiar with Shrinky Dinks, once baked the little flexible flat plastic sheets shrink, harden, and thicken to become permanent hard plastic play pieces. You can even poke a hole before baking and hang them on a necklace."

1,"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat."

He's also the youngest one in the house and it is a little challenging for him to hold the pieces together. I think it is a nice toy for a little one, but not for a grown-up.

1,"I purchased these to replace an old set of threaded dumbbell handles with rubber grips that were falling apart. The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much"

As the day goes on it becomes irritating. Because it's tight. Now I am a large and I started wearing it 3 weeks after my pregnancy. Which I had lost most of my weight. I had two kids back to back: I am 5.1 tall and weigh post pregnancy 150. Pregnancy I was 191! So actually I was more of xl but I got large. Anyhow it def fits snug. But the top of it does roll down and I read other reviews and hoped it didn't but guess what it rolls down. I find asking my husband to pull it up. Then being large chest I find it hard to snap everything together. So if you have that issue get something easier to pull up. I had c-section. Which this didn't make it that comfortable near the incision. It does give support for my back. I don't wear it much maybe if it was softer and comfortable I would! Really if you read this review try others that are cheaper. The hospital gave me a wrap to help but it wasn't that great but it def much better than this! I will post pic later. Oh it also squeeze my back fat and made it worse! Very disappointed overall and the return policy sucks cause you have to keep the tags on it. Heck you should be able to return in 30 days regardless. It even made me feel tummy aches. It will flatten you stomach while wearing it though only good thing really but it's not by much. You just gotta really work out and eat well! Eventually you will get the body back!

1,"I bought this shirt for my Dad who is in law enforcement and he is in love with these shirts. They get used on his job and doing his everyday things (like hiking).  He likes the hidden breast pockets, the quality of the material and the stitching. Although they are pricey, it is worth getting this shirt. I accidentally ordered 2 shirts of the same color at 2 different times (one for Christmas and one for his birthday) and when I realized it I offered to send one back and he refused saying ""You can never have too much of a great product."" Not to mention he is very particular and picky about his clothes. If you are thinking of buying this shirt you will not be disappointed."

I bought this second one because I like the flashlight so well, it is very bright.  However, this one has now stopped working as well, after only about 9 months or so.  I do not want the hassle of returning it for repair; will just throw it away.  It's a shame because it was a really nice flashlight while it worked.  Recently bought myself a Nitecore Tube keychain flashlight, and I really like it so far (we'll see how long IT holds up, ha) The Tube only weighs about half an ounce and it is rechargeable with a USB cable (which was not included, but the one for my basic flip phone fits)"

1,"I am very short: 4'9"".  10 years ago, I could find pants and jeans that were short enough without more than the normal petite person's problem.  Then companies started to lengthen inseams.  I was never able to find pants in stores and only ordered online from places like lands end or llbean that are very clear about inseams and will sometimes hem for free.  When I tried on these jeans in the store on a lark and they actually fit with just a little extra length, I bought an extra pair off of amazon since I never know when this will happen again!  I have hips and thighs, and these jeans are not too tight BUT the waist is tight enough without gapping.  Amazing!  A jean that made by someone who understands that there is a shape and size in between beanpole and barrel!  I was so impressed I tried buying a different petite style in the same brand, but although the shape was nice in those, there is an extra 2 inches of length that will need to be hemmed.  Sooo, I'm not convinced this brand understands that petite people are short, but for this one product, I am happy!"

1,"Listen - we know we are not alone when we say reality TV has hi-jacked network and cable television and most of it isn't really a positive force in life with its usual focus being on the nastier side of the human condition (fighting, jealousy, lying, cheating, etc. etc.) and at some point we have simply given up - so what to do after?  We became our own T.V. station!

We stopped paying the cable company hundreds and hundreds of dollars for programming we don't like (because complaining about modern television is about as helpful as peeing up hill) and we channeled that money into DVD/Blu Ray purchases of shows we know we love and this one was one the list!

Green Acres is the story of a New York lawyer who has always dreamed of owning/operating a farm - a true pioneer in the 'Back to the Land' movement (John Denver would have been proud).  But not everything is what it seems when Mr. Haney sells him a piece of useless land, a broken down house, an 'antique' tractor, and everything else one might need.  When Mr. Douglas seems too starry eyed and naive to notice his high society wife is only too happy to point out the problems.  What happens next is anyone's guess in this zany half hour comedy which we can't seem to stop watching  (even our teen daughter).  CBS made a total miss-step when it canceled this show as part of their not-so-bright cultural war against country themed shows in the so called ""rural purge"" of 1971 - at least we got 170 episodes (over many seasons) to remember it by."

1,"*This Book Was Given To Me By The Author In Exchange For An Honest Review*

This book may just be the total epitome of geekyness and I don't mean that in a bad way. It is obvious that the writer is completely in love with everything to do with this genre and the book is filled with references galore that the nerd in me reveled in at first although I must confess I preferred the earlier slightly less obvious mentions to the later ones that were quite blatent and at times I found myself lost in the ""What is that reference game"" which took me momentarily away from the focus of the story,

The book itself is split into 3 mini books each a little story within themselves. Personally I loved the first book the best and I wish that the author had carried along in that vein of thought but don't get me wrong the 2nd and 3rd books are good in their own way, they just have a different feel to them.

As the books progress the author moves you from ""almost"" reality, way into the depths of fantasy and he does it well although there are moments that felt a little forced or disjointed for me which is fairly common in newer writers.

Overall I would say if like me you are a fan of Epic Fantasy and would feel right at home in the middle of a comic con convention then this would be a good fit for you.

0,"True to Kay Arthur's study of the relationship between the two characters. There is a strong connection to the two characters that is often missed by many readers, and the author is very clear that it is a relationship between Kay and Stephanie, both of whom have come to terms with their feelings for one another. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of it. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of the relationship with Kay, and Kay is determined to get Kay out of it. The story is not only about Kay, but about Stephanie, and the book is full of both of them. There is a lot of action, and a lot of twists and turns, but it is not the most compelling story. My only criticism of the book is that the ending was a bit abrupt. There was a lot of tension in the book, and the ending was not unexpected. However, the plot of this book was well paced, and I was very excited to read the next book in the series. I have never read a book that was so abrupt that I felt like I was in a story."
1,The wig and beard look AMAZING... the only thing is that the beard elastic to hold it in place is really big. My husbands head is on the larger size (most hats don't fit him) and the beard was still super loose. He couldn't talk or move his mouth without it slipping or shifting. I suggest trying this on in time to have someone sew or adjust the straps if needed. All in all they looked great.
1,"This is one of those marriages of convenience, a trope I often like.  The hero is turned off women, resenting his mother and all the shallow, greedy women of the ton she tries to marry him off to.  The heroine is distrustful of men because of having the most horrendous, abusive father you could ever imagine.  A father who's arranging her marriage to an older ship captain and white slaver, who equals or surpasses the father in horrendous behavior.

She runs away from home to escape marriage and he runs away from London, basically for the same reason, except in his case he wasn't really in any desperate situation.

Well, you know what will happen by reading the blurb but not exactly all the particulars, some of which are fun and interesting.  No real unicorn here, of course, but the symbolism plays a part in the story.  There are also some entertaining secondary characters, although nobody is drawn with much dimension.

However, this is not Chater's best work.  I did not like the hero much. Too immature, too erratically friendly and then cold and almost mean to the heroine.  Still, the writing is good.  Chater knows her way around words and sentences, but I have to like the hero in my romance to be completely satisfied."

1,"After viewing ""His Last Vow,""  I am left absolutely stunned and I cannot wait to see what happens next.  I sympathize with fellow reviewers who have been disappointed to see a Sherlock that is less than heroic; less ""in control.""  However, his behavior in Season 3 just goes to show how important John Watson is to the stability and grounding of an almost out of control force that is Sherlock Holmes.  There are moments in ""His Last Vow"" that are simply heartbreaking to watch. The plot is completely unpredictable and left me on the edge of my seat.  Despite many harrowing moments, what carries the day is that these two friends clearly understand and trust each other despite their suffering.  This goes beyond a simple ""bromance.""  This relationship is epic and makes this version of Sherlock Holmes the most compelling I've seen.  The supporting cast is wonderful and I am glad that Mycroft, Molly, Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson have been given more screen time."

This is the second book I have read today this was shorter, simpler but I cried a lot of tears reading this story. I was definetly connected to this story.

Kelly was very sucessful and happy with her life.  She was manager of Magazine and engaged to the Owner. Then she got a call that her dad had died and left everything to her. Kelly had not seen her father or  heard from him since she was three.

Kelly flies into town plans to sign papers and leave that same weekend but she found out a little about her dad and somethings about herself.

Then after that the power light on the main unit just stayed solid, couldn't get it to work after that.  Tried changing batteries, etc, nothing.

With that said, this fruit basket far surpassed my expectations. I am honestly glad I didn't go with my first choice. This basket is modern, stylish, and very functional. There is enough clearance from the banana hanger so the bananas do not interfere with the fruit, and its a bonus that the basket itself is very deep. The fruit basket was just slightly bigger than I though it to be, but that's not really a problem for me. The brown is pretty dark, so if you are worried it will clash with other colors in your kitchen it won't. In my kitchen I have a lot of brown accents all over; at first glance it does look black, but after looking for a couple more seconds you see that it is in fact brown.

Cambrige walks away with the film, and Carol Baker is extremely effective. I so wanted to love this film all over again, but it's lost a lot of its magic. The aging makeup is terrible, and James Dean performance suddenly seeems ridiculously mannered. If it had looked a good as it should, it would have helped enormously, but this is a terrible transfer. Sorry to be a spoil sport, but compared to some of the great classics from the '40's, this isn't in the same league. I'm happy that so many people still love it however.

1,I bought this to use with my tablet and games I own because in some games it would be much easier to use a controller than pressing the screen like Metal Slug. Unfortunately the maker states more compatibility than it really has. I can get some games to kinda work and others don't work with it at all. It says there is tons of games on the market it is compatible with but only shows me 20 and I don't own any of them. I am currently trying it with other controller programs and some of them could work it better than Nyko's own program which is frankly sad. I want to be able to use and love this controller more and hope Nyko improves their program and compatibility more.

I got the black and it is exactly what I wanted. I've only worn it twice, but it's a great addition to his wardrobe. He doesn't have a lot of arch support, but it is very comfortable. I got a small and it fit perfectly, and he likes it. He's a big fan of the shoes, so I think it's great. I'm sure it will last him a while, but the price is right. He's a little disappointed in the quality of the material, but he's happy with it. He'll be wearing this sneaker all the time. Great, very comfortable, and I ordered size up.

1,"I have the biggest smile on my face after reading this book; it's the stuff your dream romance is made of.  It's honest, mature, sexy, relevant, engaging and most importantly its romantic; swoon worthy.

I started this book ready to resist liking Arden.  While she is still not my favorite character in this series, the author did a phenomenal job making her softer and vulnerable while staying true to her ""real' personality.  I certainly understood her better by the end of the book and look forward to the author unveiling the rest of her complicated layers. I think the good doctor is just what she needed in more ways than one.

The author gives us a great chance to catch up with all of your favorite couples from the previous two stories;  Ari/Riely, Athena/Denali and Daynesha/Cesar.  What I really enjoyed and respected the most was the way these couples dealt with conflict when it arose, textbook for classy and mature adults.  This book is as much about this cast of friends as it is learning more about Arden and what she needed most in her life.  You simply cannot read this book and not wish you were part of this group's inner circle.

My favorite line in the book is delivered by my favorite man in this series, Cesar, he tells Athena ""You are the diamond Dee has been longing to treasure"".

This book is well written with its depth and characterization. The drama is not overdone (thank you) and the pace is perfect.  I feel as though I know this group of friends.  The men of this series are the type of men that every girl dreams of one day making their very own.  Well done.  I do have a question......Who is up next?"

1,"Well I've had this installed for a few months. Ended up purchasing 6 more dimmers. The HomeKit interface is great. The overall quality has met my expectations for the current products on the market. My biggest tangible complaint is the wall switches have a cheap feel. The remotes feel more sturdy and less wobbly when you press the buttons. The app works well on the iPhone and watch. Siri is a bonus but Apple needs to work on their side of the integration a little more. Most of the time I can use Siri quickly for dimming or turning the lights on. The app needs some improvement with the geo location. I added my girlfriend to the app. However, I have the app programmed to turn the lights off when I leave. If my girlfriend is home it still turns them off. Not big deal but this would be a pain if you have a big family. You can easily turn this feature off if you don't like it. Lutron if you're listening please keep improving the app and hub integration with other products. Bonus points if you program an alarm clock dimmer. Overall, the best you can get for the price and quality level. 5 stars based on that fact. The reality is its more of a 4."

1,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."

1,This is how all folding chairs should be made. You get four commercial grade heavy-duty chairs that look like they will last a lifetime. They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs. I noticed that they are so much more comfortable then the common all-metal folding chairs. I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.
1,"Although it would be very easy to compare Deirdre Riordan Hall's new book, ""Sugar"" with the now classic movie ""Precious"", to compare them too closely would be doing both wonderful creations a disservice.

I never know quite what to say in these reviews, as I hate to be a spoiler, but I can say that I read Sugar in one sitting, having postponed weekend plans to do so .  I loved this book from page one.  It's real, it's honest, it'll break your heart and give you hope.  It's an instant favorite of mine, and I bet it will be an instant bestseller and classic."

1,"David S. Scott, where do I even begin to tell you how much I freaking adored this story!!!

Yes, the first ended in a cliffhanger, but you listened to your fan base when you asked how long to wait between releases. People who know me, will tell you how much I despise cliffhangers. So glad you decided to release them close together. As much as I loved the first book, I can tell you without a doubt that I enjoyed this one so much more. Let me list the ways. 1. I received the answers to all of my unanswered questions in the first novel. 2. The player was finally tamed, and holy crap it was awesome. Once again the sex was smokin' hot. And not only that, we also got to see Xander's sweet and vulnerable sides. Love it!
3. Enjoyed the little bit of suspense you threw into the mix. Although, I kind of figured it all out before it was actually revealed, but I was still enthralled until the very end. 4. It ended with and HEA. Bonus points!

You really have wowed me a second time! I'm so glad to have gotten the chance to read your books, and I look forward to reading more of your work in the future."

1,"Elizabeth Hand is able to do what so many writers strive for -- to emulate Joseph Conrad when he says, ""My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the written word, to make you hear, to make you feel  it is, before all, to make you see. That  and no more, and it is everything."" This is the most deeply *visual* prose I've read since...well, since Conrad.

With this in mind, one line from the book struck me: ""How many of us can say we've made a new world out of the things that terrify and move us?"" Well,Elizabeth Hand can, anyway. There's not a lazy sentence in this entire book, which is one of the few out there that any writer can read and learn from, and any reader will find a powerful and moving experience.

by Charles R. Young

Published in the May 18, 2009 issue of The New Yorker. I enjoyed this book well enough. It is a fascinating story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over a decade. I especially liked the fact that the story is set in the past. I was quite surprised to see that the author is working on a sequel to the book, The Lord of the Rings. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy or fantasy/thriller/adventure. I really enjoyed this book. I read it to a friend, and I enjoyed it very much. It is an excellent story about a family and how it all came together in the end. It is a story about a family. It is a story about a family."

1,"I really love these flip flops, most comfortable ones ever!  The texture on the sole of your foot feels good, and is ""dryer"" than some other flip flops/ other materials/ that is, less slippery if wet.  I probably didn't explain that well  but you know what I mean, I hope.  The shoes are attractive, comfortable, convenient, I've been wearing them daily!!  I do find I have a contact sensitivity which might limit my ability to wear these.  I.e, allergy to rubber or some component.  The red is worse, unfortunately, my feet broke out in itchy rash.  It might be from the red dye.  But, I am not giving up too easily, as I've worn these many times before the skin/ foot concern occurred.  I really hope I can keep wearing these.  I have others in rubber that I can wear but not for long periods.  Perhaps these will be similar.  I have them in gray and red.  I will keep trying to wear them for shorter, or hopefully for longer periods, as they really are just about perfect.  I hate when I react to a clothing item I love.  Which is not often (wool, for example).  One star off cause of the allergy."
1,"First thing I noticed is that the escutcheon *looks* nice with the nickel finish, but it is cheap plastic.  I have no doubt that after a few good cleanings, even the most modest of scrubbing pads would leave this looking awful.

Second thing is that it didn't even fit.  I'm replacing an original Moen trim kit.  My originial sits flush to the wall.  This one has about a 3.5"" ring that needs to be recessed into the wall by 1/4"" - not something easy to accomplish on an existing tile wall.  I have about a 2"" diameter hole where the valve comes out, but it's not big enough.  You can see what I'm talking about in the product picture - where the handle is attached, you can see that circle there and how it is recessed.

The one nice thing (not that it benefitted me at all) is that this kit tries to replace both old & new Moen configurations by providing several inserts to choose from.  This way you can match it to most Moens regardless of how your current one screws in to the valve.

I'm looking for a different kit that 1) sits flush and 2) might have a more durable faceplate."

1,"I struggled with how to rate this one. The first half of this book is one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read. Like Kaiden, I was completely immersed in Serena and Elodie's world. The writing style is so compelling, and the pace of the story is perfect. The progression of the sexual tension is also incredibly exciting, even when it's one sided. That is an astounding accomplishment on its own. The author created amazing chemistry between Kaiden and Serena right from the beginning. I realize now that part of that was due to what a unique character Serena was and how fascinated he was by her.

Unfortunately, Serena later loses her uniqueness and becomes a regular girl in love. Considering the physical prowess she displayed in the first part of the story, I was expecting her to become an amazing athlete or to do something extraordinary. I still highly recommend this book for the thrilling first half of the story, but the end didn't fulfill the potential of these characters."
1,"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!
  Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.
  Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.
  One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.
  Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.
  After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.
  The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

0,"I bought this light on a whim and thought it would be a nice addition to my bike. It is so bright and bright I am able to see the light from the side and it is easy to adjust to fit in the trunk of my car. This light is excellent. The light is bright enough to see my bike and it also has a low profile on the front so you don't have to worry about it falling off. The light is bright enough to see when I am riding in the dark and it is easy to see when I am out in the dark. I am 6' and 185 lbs and the light is great for someone with a large head. It is a good size and I like that it does not have any rubber pads or striping. It is also light enough to be worn under your clothing. It does not have any screws to hold the light down or anything like that. It does not have the polarized reflector. It is a good deal for a single source light and it is good enough for someone who is always looking for a bright light to use when riding on the road. It does not come with any locking or locking mechanisms and I can't see anything from the outside.

I have a large head and this light is perfect for me. I am 5'11"" and my head is a little long so I am not too big. I am 6'5"" and it fits perfectly.

1,"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it."

I have never had this happen before with other collars and would compare it burns left by a cattle prode. Even at a low setting, my dog yelped. I am an owner who uses this to correct bad behavior, not to torture. Im pretty sad that this thing is so extreme but the vibration and noise settings are just fine."

UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct."

1,"I installed this thermostat on a single stage Water Furnace geothermal unit.  Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data."

1,"Adam Schonberg is in medical school and trying to make ends meet without the support of either his or his wife, Jennifer's, parents.  His family was not happy when he married outside the Jewish religion.  Now he finds that their already struggling family of two is about to be a family of three and he doesn't know how to cope or manage financially.  Jennifer will have to quit her job as a dancer and so Adam decides to take a leave of absence from medical school to go work for a drug company.  But all is not what it seems with their fancy corporate headquarters and high dollar paychecks.  Adam soon finds himself in the middle of a corporate plan to take over the field of medicine by drugging and mind controlling as many doctors as the company can get their hands on.  All the while, Adam must deal with the conflict developing between Jennifer and himself because of his suspicions that her OBGYN is drugged as well.

Cook weaves an extremely interesting conspiracy theory about how the business world is beginning to affect medicine and it's treatment, or lack thereof, of patients.  It confronts the  idea that for-profit companies will continue to have an influence on the field of medicine that is not always as positive as these companies would lead you to believe.  The unfortunate aspect of this book was that the story line jumped from idea to idea a bit and often portrays Jennifer in a overly simplistic and patronizing manner.  Just when the adventure really heats up, the story ends abruptly and rather predictably.  A story with a lot of potential ended flat and in disappointment.  Still, one still finishes with the contemplation that Cook intended."

1,"The Prizzi's are the second best (celluloid) Mafia family ever to come out of New York.  The script is a masterwork, the best line deadpanned by Nicholson to John Randolph: ""I didn't get married so my wife could go on working (in Brooklynese, it comes out ""woiking"").""  William Hickey, frail, onion skinned, gravel voiced is unforgettable as Don Corrado Prizzi (lovingly called Padrino <Godfather> by Jack's Charlie Partanna).  The Oscar won by Angelica Houston was richly deserved in what was her great father's next to last film."
1,"First I'll talk about the set-up process. Mercy, it was a pain! Once I got over the overwhelming amount of pieces and hardware, the set-up started off easily enough. I was fooled into thinking things would go smoothly. That changed quickly. I had a hard time getting many of the little hardware pieces to fit where they were supposed to. It was very frustrating. The worst part, I think, was the sticky paper that was attached to the glass-like plastic shelves. It did not come off easily! I ended up having to buy a bottle of ""goo gone"" to help get it off, because it looked so horrible.

Now to the looks of the final product. I don't really have any complaints. It not overly my style, so it's ended up as a storage shelf in my boys' closet. It's hard black plastic and thick white paper for the most part. It looks like something you'd see in a garage or maybe a dorm room or classroom setting. I think more than anything, it will depend on a person's individual style.

Overall, is this something I would recommend to my family and friends? No, unfortunately not. I think there are easier and less expensive options for what it is. Other than the set-up process, though, I don't have any complaints at this point, so I also wouldn't overly NOT recommend it, either."

1,"Granted I'm not really a mystery person and my apology to those who really liked this book but I thought it was choppy, confusing, and not worth finishing. The introduction of new characters was not smooth at all, the segue between Germany and Lisbon had too many gaps. The unfinished tome will sit in my Kindle."

1,"This story, Unruly Hearts, really delivered the romance that I was looking for in spades. I found West simply irresistible, the combination of hot, handsome, well-intentioned neighbor struggling with awkwardly emerging lover along with a heroine who stars in this story for much more than her beauty was perfect. The love that grew between West and Annie reminded me of what my mother told me about love - when a man says he loves you when you look your best, it's a compliment, when he says it in the garden and you're covered in dirt, it's a declaration! In this story you also get a second romance, a mix-up on engagements, and a really nasty villain! Another thing I liked about this story was the strong female friendships that are too seldom found in literature. This story was well written and the story flowed well. The imagery was exceptionally well done; I could practically see, hear, smell, and especially taste the dust behind the cattle. The only false note in the story was Clara. I felt her hesitation about setting a wedding date didn't fit her character and her indecision about marrying West when she had feelings for Jones just plain felt wrong to me. That's why I gave this story four stars instead of five but even with this one flaw, it's still a very enjoyable romance with some graphic lovemaking but no vulgar language. (The reason I said ""lovemaking"" is there is nothing more than passionate kissing until West and Annie are engaged. ) For anyone looking for a historical western romance that makes you give a big smile at the HEA ending, then I definitely recommend this one."

I'm uncertain if it was caused by the demand from FSX but I do know something was notably wrong. To be fair, I may just have received a faulty piece of hardware. Nonetheless, after the third nose-dive; out it came. I didn't care about warranties at that point and I am thankful that my OS was not on it. Sadly, it was the worst hard drive that I ever had. I replaced it with a 250 GB SSD which has been magnificent. My current opinion is that Solid State is the only way to go."

Only reason for not getting five stars is that it's aesthetically rough... there's clearly no finish work done to this item once that stamp it out and assemble it at the plant... other than a quick, shabby paint job (which, for the record is orange, not yellow as in the picture)... but again, these are all issues with the way it looks, which I could care less about... It does the job, and it's way cheaper than it's closest competitor."

1,"This was a pain to assemble (you need strong thumbs to force the clips onto the wires), but so very worth it!  A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.

Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.

Would I recommend this cage?  Yes, I may even buy another one for ""cat tree"" use myself if they bring the white one back into stock -- cages in the livingroom are not exactly ""high design"" -- I'd like them to at least match."

I had a lot of fun with this book, but I was not as enthralled as I was in the first book. There are some parts that I find amusing, but mostly it's just a quick read. I'm not sure if it's a good book or not, but I will say that it's pretty good.

The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad. They just seem to be sort of stuck in the past. It's a nice way to introduce new characters and introduce a lot of new ideas.

I think I'm going to give this book a four star, but I have to say that I didn't like the ending, and I really didn't like the way the author ended it. I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.

1,"Vanilla Sky is a visually and intellectually fascinating film that many viewers and critics found too confusing to enjoy. What starts out as a surreal mystery turns out to be an exploration into the nature of reality. In this way, it is similar to The Matrix, Dark City and some other recent films where the characters are never sure what is real and what is a dream (or computer-generated fantasy). Vanilla Sky also has some David Lynch-like features, as when people's identities seem to randomly morph. Unlike Lynch films such as Mulholland Drive, however, Cameron Crowe's story at least offers an explanation for the confusion. The explanation won't satisfy everyone (as some of the harsh criticism of the film shows), but to focus too much on this is to miss the point, which is to make us ponder some big questions regarding truth and reality. Helped by some very good performances by Tom Cruise, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz, and some stunning visual effects (such as a truly eerie scene of a deserted New York City), Vanilla Sky is an entertaining and intellectually stimulated film. Just don't  expect a straightforward, linear story."

It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes."

0,"I'm very disappointed in this product. The quality is just not good. The opener is a bit difficult to get off the dishwasher, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars. The blades are not sharp enough to get the butter from the bottom to the edge of the pan. The pan is very thin and it will not hold the butter evenly. I wish I'd seen a better product. I'm not sure if the metal handles hold up well to hot water, but it is a nice quality product. I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update: After several months of use, I have noticed that the handles are too short. I would recommend that you buy the other brand and get a longer handle. It is a nice product for a good price.The foam is a little flimsy but I have used it for about a month and it still works. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

1,"I was quite spell-bound about this book. God uses ordinary people to do extraordinary things. The lessons learned indicate that God is so alive today and speaks through his Word. Why did God use this child, one would want to know, but God uses us everyday to share his word. We are sometimes afraid to speak to others concerning how God works. I went to the website and listened to Ms. Brown share the story. As the story progressed, the reader is praying for a miracle to take place and Tara is healed completely but God had different plans."

He is much smaller than I thought he would be, he looks cheap, his facial features are not placed in a way that looks normal, his head was not sewn correctly so it is crooked and smashed on one side. I kept him because my child specifically asked Santa for this character in a doll or stuffed version and I couldn't find another of any kind of this character.  My child loves him with all of his imperfections so it was not a waste of my money. The material and stitching are sturdy and he has held up very well with being handled and a constant companion to my child.

These shoes will be great for the hot summer months."
1,"Price to performance, this tool is pretty great. Performs extremely well with very light use. But as soon as you start to torque with this, forget it, you're better off using your bare hands.
The handles of the pliers, after about 3 weeks of light use, began to flop around which made this tool useless. The joints where the pliers and the handles join is crucial to the performance of this tool. There is no way to take this tool apart and repair those joints. So if it fails, the tool is garbage."

1,"I bought this for my dog  and he likes it very much, which says a lot because he is usually a picky dog. This food actually looks similar to corned beef, minus the white colored fat, this just has a spoonful of congealed juices at the bottom of the can. I did think it would have more gravy in it given its sold as a gravy cravers dog food but that's alright, I can add just a little warm water for gravy. Its mostly a smooth pate of food, except the Filet Mignon, that has slight chunks along with the pate. This doesn't smell nasty, it actually does smell quite good. Similar to canned beef stew. All and all, this is a very good canned food for the price. Its also nice that I can have it shipped to my home with prime. Another thing, I wanted to mention, I've seen the reviews others have left saying their dog had gastrointestinal upsets, mine did not, I think it does vary from dog to dog, but I've not had any issues.

Edited 11/07/2015  I bought several cases since my original review because my dog loves this food and its so easy to just have this delivered to my home. I'm happy, my dog's happy and my cat's are happy they have a box to play in.

Feels very cheap and made out of very cheap / fragile plastic. Throwing it in a tool bag would probably damage it.

There is no way I would trust it to be accurate and use it in any situation. It is a dangerous device in my opinion and will frequently give ""False negative"" readings - indicating there is no power running through a wire when there actually is.

1,"Machine Man is a fairly dark satire about the extent to which we covet technology. The first few pages are the most relatable as we meet our protagonist (if he can be called that) as he realizes he can't find his cell phone. While not everyone uses their cell phone for pretty much everything, most people could even relate to the way he feels by thinking about a time when you can't find the remote control for the television and spend 20 minutes looking for it rather than changing channels manually. Technology appears, and before you know it we don't know what we would do without it. This sets up the theme for the book as Charlie loses his leg in an accident at work. Being unhappy with the prostheses available to him he proceeds to build his own. Thus begins a journey to constantly Better himself, and though his designs are for his own use, his company quickly sees their marketability, not just for people who have lost their limbs, but for people who want better parts than they were born with. What follows is a tale of technology that progresses faster than we can really learn to deal with it, with disastrous consequences for all involved. The book is infused with a dry humor and insightful philosophy about our relationship to technology and only really lost my attention in the last third when it became more of an action movie. But it is a fun novel and I will probably pick up other books by Max Barry."
1,"When Mark Wahlberg openly implies the mistake he made in taking on the role he played in this film, you know there's a serious problem.

M. Night Shyamalan is a man who clearly needs to redeem himself. ""The Sixth Sense"" was remarkable, ""Unbreakable"" was absolutely incredible, and ""Signs"" was consistently engaging. Everything after those three have been total train-wrecks. I absolutely did not like ""The Village,"" and I thought ""Lady In The Water"" was just about the very worst thing I'd ever seen put to film. But ""The Happening?"" Well, let's just say I was less than thrilled.

An unknown airborne virus that drives common everyday people to inexplicably commit suicide. Think of what could be done with an idea like that! So much more could have been explored on this theme, and yet all we're left with is Wahlberg, John Leguizamo and several other ragtag survivors who do nothing but flee from one random spot to another in some lame attempt to outrun a force they can't even see! Sorry, I guess I was just expecting something a bit more substantial! Shyamalan certainly has it within him to deliver far more interesting stories. But what we get with this is something prone to a rare, substandard dud from ""The Twilight Zone.""

All I can say is, I'm glad I only paid one dollar to rent this at a redbox. Even that, I feel, was too much money.

I really do admire and respect the talent M. Night Shyamalan has proven to possess by virtue of his earlier work. But he is in dire need of getting his act together. Three bombs in a row does not bode well for any director's future in the industry.

To any potential viewers, be forewarned. There's not much of anything ""happening"" throughout this entire movie."
0,"I adored this book, but it has some flaws.  It is not as riveting as the other two books in the series.  There is some basic violence, but it is not that common.  It is not as gory as the other books in the series.  The only thing that I found was the fact that it was written in the first person.  I found it annoying when I had to read it over and over.  I don't feel like I have to read it again, but I am sure I will.

1,"It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools."

1,"I have not read any of the books in this series so I was excited to start this. I really enjoyed this love story. There was a lot of chemistry between Kate and Brody. Kate was smart, honest and down to earth, something I don't usually find in female characters. I loved Brody! He came across as quite vulnerable which I like in a male character. It made a change to see a male character like that. These two characters are great on their own but together they really smoulder. They show a united front and both speak their mind. The love scenes weren't particularly steamy, I prefer a bit more detail but I don't think that would have suited this book. The plot was good and very well written. Overall this was a wonderfully sweet, romantic book."

0,"5 year update: switch 1/2"" wide and 2"" long.

The switch has a self-healing mechanism. The ""healing"" is not a great feature, but it's a great feature.

I was thinking about changing the battery to a lithium-ion battery, but I ended up going with a non-dimmable version of this switch.

So I had to install a different switch to replace the one with a non-dimmable one.

The other switch I used was a lithium-ion version, which is still a great feature, but it's more expensive than the one I replaced.

I replaced the battery with a non-dimmable one.

So I can't comment on how it will perform, but it's certainly a nice feature.

The lights are bright and well built. They're very well made and have a very good feel.

My only complaint is that they don't come with a good set of pliers to hold the switch. I don't like that, but it would be nice if they included a set of pliers as well."

1,"Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

Overall, I love Amazon products and will definitely be ordering more!"

1,"Margaret OMalley, a 13-year-old girl living in the small mining town of Victory, Arizona, has just found out that her father, a whistle-blower geologist, not intimidated by Victory Fuels bad practices, has been sentenced to death for arson and murder by the vindictive Judge. Desperate to help her father and save his life, Margaret is assured by her best friends grandfather that she has the special ability to do so.

Charlies grandfather, Joshua Garrett, has a complicated history with Victory and the coal mining company that founded it. The Garrett family moved to the dry desert climate of Arizona to alleviate young Prestons asthma, but when Frederic Garrett went to work in the mine, the family began to experience another form of hardship and danger. Frederic Garrett and his friend Aristotle Agrippa, along with many other miners, take on Victory Fuels, but the cost is high.

Decades later, their actions result in John OMalleys conviction.  The secret, both OMalley family and Joshua Garrett kept, is that they are able to time-travel. Grandpa Joshua hopes that sending Margaret back in time to the moment his friend Luke Agrippa becomes the hard-hearted Lucas Biggs will save her father and rectify past wrongs.  But Grandpa Joshua and Charlie quickly learn that trying to change the past is not enough, so they turn their attention to find a plan to save Lucas Biggs

The threatening execution of John OMalley subsidizes the story with painful strain, but hopefulness, and ethics in standing up for what is right, resisting corruption makes up for that tension and pain. Despite the OMalley ability to time-travel, the elements of fantasy are actually kept to a minimum, bringing the story to a factual resolution. The story starts with these questions and takes readers on an exciting adventure within the heart of several genuine characters."

Update:

I was thinking about going with this camera and decided to buy a Canon 2D with a 2D sensor.  I have had several Canon 3D cameras and I just can't get enough of them.  The 2D sensor is perfect for me.  I have had no problems shooting the 3D, I shoot with my Canon, not with the camera.  The Canon 2D is great for the price.  I have not had any issues shooting 3D on this camera.  The only issue I have is the battery life.  I have had a 3D camera for several years now and have had good battery life.  I just wish the 2D was a little longer but I am happy with this camera.

1,"Jet, the 6th episode of Secret Confessions: Backstage  is the hottest of the series and one story Id like to see continued.  Jet is the real drive behind The Screaming Tuesdays, the real master of their music.  All the Tuesdays are talented in their own right, but Jet is the total package, even though his voice is his instrument on stage, he can play all instruments well (though he demurs about bagpipes).  He is obsessive about his notebook, where he keeps his works-in-progress, his thoughts and his secrets.  He has been wanting to get his hands (mouth, body) on Charlie since he first saw her on the first day of the US tour.

Charlie has been embedded with The Screaming Tuesdays since the beginning of the US tour.  A reporter looking for the in-depth true story about the band, the tour and the individual Tuesdays; she has kept her distance from all the members of the band and their support team.  She wants nothing to tarnish her reputation as a reporter and devalue her work.  She knows how quickly her reputation can be lost if she is linked to anyone she interviews.  She has been painfully aware of Jet from the first moment and has delayed his interview until the last.

The last day of the tour, the last night, after the last concert, Charlie is scheduled to do her in-depth interview with Jet.  Jet made a decision to avoid alcohol for the US tour; he states hes not an alcoholic and it is just a personal choice.  The Tuesdays have been betting against him, but the US tour is over and the betting pool is unclaimed.  Yanis brings Charlie to Jets suite just as hes about to shower off after the performance.  Jet doesnt want to do the interview with Charlie because hes unsure he can keep his hands off her.  Chicago is about to get hot!"

0,"One Con that's acceptable enough, and not too bad, is that it's a little hard to put on.  I had to replace a couple of the plastic plastic strips to get it to work properly.  It's not a huge deal, but it is very annoying to put on.  I don't think I'll be able to use it for much longer than a day of riding.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact bike that won't require much to do.

The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.  I will probably get a shorter bike for the money.  I'll just go with the larger bikes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bike that won't require much to do.

I would not recommend this to anyone looking for a more compact bike.  It's a nice bike, but it's not a great one.  It will work fine for me, but I wouldn't recommend it.

1,"I went back and forth on this beam vs other brand balance beams that were $100 less expensive.  Finally decided that I would invest the extra cash and get this beam.

LOVE this beam.  Came in two packages.  Opened both the packages and just dropped the beam into the legs and voila, instant beam.  No assembly required.  VERY sturdy.  My husband who is 6' 4"" and 215 pounds had no problem walking across it.  The beam did not bend.  Obviously, my husband won't be using it daily.  But I wanted to see if it could really support 200+ pounds like claimed.  ( I believe I read 250 lb)  But my 50lb daughter is the primary user.  But like said, no problem supporting him.  So I am pleased that my daughter will be able to use it for a long time.

I love the height of this beam.  Tall enough so you don't feel like it's on the floor and you can practice scoops.  But low enough that you don't get scared to practice new skills.  I also like the option to purchase leg in the future to increase the height.

Very pleased with the quality."

It's a little difficult for a younger child to understand.  The rules are simple enough to understand that it's not difficult to understand.  It's a little challenging for older kids.  This is not a ""best"" game, but it's well worth the price.  I recommend this for all ages.Cute, fun game for our little ones!  We have been playing it a few times now and it has been a favorite.  It is a fun game for all ages"
1,"The Turning Point isn't as lightweight as it appears. Shirley MacLaine's performance as the dancer-turned-mother and wifie, and Ann Bancroft's role as the aging ballerina who won't let go of the past is quite realistic. Each woman is struggling with an ego that won't allow them to voice their true emotions, all fear-based and poignant. One fears that she wasn't ever good enough to become the star her friend went on to be, and hides behind motherhood and a veiled jealousy of her daughter who is definitely on her way. The other is also jealous of the life her friend has, and fears growing old and being forgotten by the dance world she loves and hates. As Shirley MacLaine's character seeks answers through infidelity and anger, Ann Bancroft takes Shirley's daughter hostage, pets and spoils her - all to feed her own self-confidence.  Frankly, I think the cat fight on the roof is a wonderful scene, because finally, the two friends are able to show her fear and anger of being forgotten and growing old, and express their desire for something they can never have, for whatever reason, to each other. Watching Mikhail leap through the air is indeed a pleasure as well; but I personally enjoy his love scenes and Leslie Brown's long arms reaching to the sky as she falls in love with him.  It's a wonderful movie. See it, buy it, love it for what it is."

My only criticism is that the ending, while not bad, was a bit anti-climatic.  I read this book while I was traveling and it really occupied those boring hours waiting in airports and on planes.  A four star recommendation for this one."

1,"This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on."

The fact that there are a lot of hard-working, loving fathers in that community needs to be told often and in a manner that is fun and easy to read. This book accomplishes this without being preachey - just real."
1,"I want to start this review stating that I have read each one of  Kristan Higgins books.  I have enjoyed many ""Just one of the Guys"" being my favorite.  I wanted to love this book too.  I did like it at first.  I just think it is so un-plausable that  someone who had more money than God, could give it up and not be a lot more mad about losing it.  I did like the excerpts of the ""Holly Rollers"", her children novel's.  There were parts that were funny, but most the time I thought it was just trying to hard.  Kristan Higgins is very talented and I love the humor she brings to her novels, this one just wasn't her best work yet."

1,"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole). Lose a significantly cheaper one than this."
1,"I bought this for my parrotlet (size small). It is a little bit big but my parrotlet likes it and I see him sitting on these often. It is great for his beak, he uses it to rub his beak on and keep it in good shape.

If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner. And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want. 1)  Put your veggies in the bowl. Pour a cup of white vinegar over it, and fill with cold water. Agitate it with your (clean, recently washed) hands and let it sit for a few minutes. 2)  Lift the basket out and pour out the vinegar / water. Fill again with cold water and agitate by hand. 3)  Lift the basket and pour out the water, then spin, spin spin. 4)  Pour out the water and wipe the remaining droplets with a paper towel. 5)  Put the basket back in, lock the spinner down, and store in the fridge. Lettuce and spinach lasts twice as long using this method than just storing in the fridge."

1,"I used this to tap a custom wooden live center for my Jet 1642 lathe. It's just the right thread size for the threads on the stock live center, once you remove the cone. So I made something out of maple, drilled a 5/8"" hole in it, and tapped it with this. Then I poured in a bit of thin CA glue to strengthen the wooden threads and screwed the tap in one more time to cut the threads perfectly. Now I have a wooden live center to hold the back of bowls without piercing them. This tap was indispensable for that."
1,"I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far."

0,"I've been reading Sir Terry Pratchett's books for a long time, and I'm pretty sure that I have had a similar experience.  The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a group of young women who are going to kill him.  The young woman is a fourteen-year-old girl, and the group of women is so obsessed with killing her that they have to take her away from her.  They all have plans to kill her, and they all get together.  The story starts out fairly straightforward, with a young woman in a wheelchair being abducted and killed.  She doesn't have a lot of tools, but she is a fairly skilled fighter and she does a good job of keeping herself safe.  She's also a very clever, intelligent woman, and the group of women are quite good at making sure that the children are safe, too.  I really liked that the group of women were mostly young people, but they also had a lot of good qualities, such as being very intelligent and strong, so they would be very able to handle situations, and they were a bit stubborn about it.  I loved that the story was fairly straightforward, and I was quite impressed with how"

1,"Customer service/warranty from this company is non exsistant. I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty). If you have hard water, forget it because it will never come clean. I was very very disappointed with this and even more with the companies lack of care in their product especially since I have owned older models for my cats in the past."

1,"Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed."

1,"A First Rate Madness: Uncovering the Links between Leadrship and Mental Illness is a book you might want to read.  Some will find the historical illustrations thin while others may find the analysis provided a stretch in place, but Nassiar Ghaemi has published one interesting book.  Ghaemi is the director of the Mood Disorder Program at Tuft Medical School.  Using available historical and medical evidence, he argues that various mood disorders can be  linked to success in leadership situations.  In individual sections he takes up creativity, realism, empathy, and resilience.  He finally takes up treatment and mental in general.  Along the way, he illustrates his views using the lives of well known persons including Bush, Blair, Nixon, JFK, Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Lincoln Churchill.  Just the character sketches that Ghaemi uses is worth the price of the book.  This is one of the more thought provoking books that I have read in the past couple of years.

This man is out for revenge, and threatens to expose her hiding place and kill innocent bystanders if she refuses a duel. She must find a way to defeat this bloodthirsty madman without killing him. Even if she can, will he give up on pursuing revenge and exposing them.

This is a great volume. It's probably one of the best volumes yet. That's a really hard call to make because all of them have been excellent. This anime is getting better all the time, and I think I'm getting addicted. It's one of those that makes you want to stay up late, even though you have to be up before the sun comes up tomorrow. I definitely recommend watching it, but probably on the weekend."

1,"I received this pack today, 2 days after ordering it.  Sold and shipped from Amazon, and I paid  $75.79 for the silt gray in small/medium.  I was planning on writing this review after using this pack.  But I'm so impressed by its design that I want to shout it out!  :)  I plan to use the Raptor 10 for long road bike rides in the Colorado Rockies.  I usually stuff my bike jersey pockets with snacks, chap stick, cell phone, small wallet, warm gloves, warm synthetic hat, reading glasses in eye glass case (so I can see what I'm doing to change flats!), inhaler, and I tie a long sleeve bike jacket around my waist!  Wow!!  I'm looking forward to using the Raptor 10 on my next ride!  I'll update my review soon.

Update:  July 24, 2012
So far, I've used this pack on two long road bike rides, where I spent a good amount of time climbing out of the saddle.  It is still a 5 star item to me.  Love the design of the water system!  The pack felt comfortable against my back w/o any noticeable water sloshing.  Everything came out of my back jersey pockets and into my Osprey.  Sweet!!!!  More back comfort!  On my first bike ride, I found the straps were so easy to use that I made ALL of my strap adjustments while riding!!  What a well designed pack.  It's too small for day hikes though, but perfect size for bike rides!!!  Planning to get another Osprey pack that's big enough for my day hikes."

1,"Clearly written for and marketed to the audience of the Hunger Games books, this series looks to be not nearly as involving as Collins'. (And could the cover be any more an almost rip-off of the Hunger Games covers?)

The problem with Divergent is that the main character isn't nearly as easy to relate to as Katniss Everdeen. In fact, she's downright unlikeable for much of the book. And the setting, with the rigidly divided society, just doesn't really make sense.

This isn't a bad book, and I'm sure a lot of readers will find it enjoyable, but it wasn't for me. I won't be bothering with the rest of the series because I can't find it in myself to care what happens to these characters. Congrats to those who enjoy it, though."

1,"It is time to wrap this series up! Before I even read this book I could have told you the following things were going to happen:
* Someone would die.
* Lulu would wear something ""poison green""
* Stephanie would be in a bind and call on the men in her life for help.
* Something would blow up.
* Stephanie would not be driving the same car at the beginning and end of the book.
* Grandma Mauzer would go to at least one viewing at the funeral home.
* Stephanie would sleep with both the men in her life.
Well, I was right. This book is chick-lit-lite -- it took one evening to read and while enjoyable there was nothing that knocked my socks off. And it's getting hard to justify spending the money to buy the book instead of waiting to check it out of the library or borrowing it from a friend. In fact, I would recommend either of those options if you have not already purchased the book.
It is time for Stephanie to make a decision and move on. Let this series end at 20 and call it a day.
It's time for Stephanie Plum to grow up, her stupidity is getting tiresome.
Let 19 be the book where she makes a choice and 20 be the wedding. It's time."
1,"Alien Nation isn't just a sci-fi show masquerading as a cop show.  It's equal & intelligent measures of both and reminds the viewer what can be accomplished when serious treatment of science fiction is presented to a mainstream audience.

Too often Sci-Fi gets a ""cult"" label - something only Star Trek or Star Wars people should watch or love.  However, when you look at the lists of the most profitable movies of all time, you find many science fiction titles - E.T. The Extraterrestrial, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and of course the Star Wars films.  If so many people are going to see these movies, then how can one justify the ""cult"" label?  To be fair, there is much sci-fi that isn't done well, however when it's a focused production like Alien Nation, audiences are treated to quality, intelligent entertainment with more than just car chases and gun fights.

Unfortunately FOX didn't include any extras on this release, but at least we have these great episodes.  Treat yourself to great, memorable stories and characters and pick up this DVD set."

1,"Set in 14th century England, Lord of Fairley, Jonathan is being forced to marry. The king has given him two weeks to find a bride, or one will be found for him. In an attempt to help him, his mother enlists the aid of Lady Alice, the daughter of one of her friends, while making it clear to Jonathan that Alice is not a suitable bride for him. Together, Alice and Jonathan make a list of all the eligible ladies at court and begin to plan ways for Jonathan to meet the ladies and determine their suitability.

The meddling by Margaret led to numerous humorous situations, awkward meetings, and two main characters both wondering why the other wasn't a suitable match. Both the plot and characters were relatively straightforward. There were no major plot twists to jump out at readers. The characters behaved true to character, again with few surprises. They were easy to like, if a bit blind to the manipulation going on around them.

This was a cute story. As far as historical romance goes, it was pretty light on historical details beyond the setting and a few period specific situations. As long as readers can picture a royal court, period dress, and a lack of modernity, there is no real need for background knowledge or even interest in historical events.

As it has been a while since my last historical read, this was a fun change of pace. I found myself grinning at Margarets antics and the reactions of both Alice and Jonathan to the maneuvering going on around them. It was an entertaining, quick read, full of humor and fun.

1,"As others have said, they are a bit tinny, however, for my relatively simple needs, they're fine. I got them to replace an old pair of speakers for my desktop. They're even adequate for music for non-serious listeners, but the bass, as has been said, almost disappears. I also wanted something relatively small, due to limited desktop space, and these certainly are---the other speakers certainly weren't huge, but these really do give me some extra space. Lastly, as has also been said, the instructions talk about two cables, a green and a pink, which is usually for input with a microphone. However, there's only the green cable, which is fine. Plug it into the input jack, plug the normal size power cord into an outlet, and you're good to go. (The fact that it's a standard 2 prong plug, rather than a large brick like my old speakers, was a further bonus. )

1,"The ring is nice except it doesn't match the picture.  The metal is a smoke color, not the polished silver color shown.  The darkness of the metal takes away from the luster of the CZ.

The straps are padded and my sweat doesn't seep through and make everything wet because its waterproof. I would buy again, for sure."

1,"Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area. I used this camera to replace a inexpensive fixed lens camera that fogs up after rain. But that camera covered the entire area in an even light."
1,"Things that are terrifying or filled with sadness are not necessarily without beauty. The Book Thief is a story that exemplifies that principle. The characters are real and complex and the plot is captivating. But more than that, it's a book that shows the humanity of different individuals, while not shying away from the brutality of others. Using Death as the narrator adds another dimension to the novel. Nothing is new to Death, and yet he is moved and intrigued by this story and shares it with us, showing us the complexity of humanity. The Book Thief is the best contemporary young adult book I've read. I know some people feel it was wrongly marketed that way, but I think it fits the audience well, while not writing down to them. The voice and style are distinct enough to make it feel special, while the subject matter and characters are real enough to tell a great deal of truth about the human condition. It will be interesting to watch and see if it finds a place in school literature curricula. (9."

1,"After taking Basic Obedience three times all the while my puppy has grown from 33lbs to 85lbs, my trainer suggested we try this harness.  It's very comfortable for the dog because it goes over their shoulder and latches under their belly.  It connects in the front by their chest.  I went from looking like I was in a water skiing competition to someone walking a dog.  He's 3 now but every now and then a deer catches his eye and you have more control than a leash by itself."

He has great upper body strength and will pull up to a 40 degree.  He likes that he can carry around his phone, keys, and other stuff.  I use this with my pack, camping, and other gear.  I like that it has a couple of pockets for some tools and a small storage pouch for some other stuff.  I also like that it is easy to carry around and move around.

1,"Even though I gave this movie four stars (for originality and for its contribution to the genre),with a bigger budget(a Leone/Morricone kind of treatment),better dialogue (the dub-job was,quite frankly,abyssmal)and some fine tuning on the plot,this movie could have been the greatest western of all time. The opening scene where this mysterious stranger (Django)is dragging this coffin through the mud and its contrast against the sentimental crooning of the opening music is,possibly,one of the weirdest visuals I've ever seen in a movie,let alone a western. There are a couple of stomach turningly violent scenes that I did not care for and the body count is probably comparable to ""the matrix""....I don't know what all to say...This is one weird,gloomy,gothic,machine gun,spaghetti western. The addition of the trailer and the Franco Nero interview were nice bonuses."

The low power level is useless for transmitting more than a few feet.  The high power level gives a pretty nice signal through my whole house and garage.  I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.  This is probably the fault of the FM receiver on the mp3 player, which uses the headphones as an antenna.  If you want to transmit to a stationary receiver (or maybe a higher-quality portable receiver), it should be fine."

1,"Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel."

It would fit a mini couch, or a overstuffed chair but not a standard loveseat. The microfiber cloth is very thin too. One of the selling points which attracted me to the cover was its elastic back supportive strap, well the strap was so short I couldn't stretch the strap over the couch's back so I just cut if off.

Those of us who are fans of the Cora's Bond and Cora's Choice series know the storyline from Cora's point of view.  Now we can follow what happened through Dorian's eyes.  Book 3 takes us up to the time Cora is introduced to the vampire community as Dorian's new cognate, chosen with the help of his new technology created to help cut the number of individuals who must die in the process of finding a mate.  An exciting race to save Cora from others who would do her harm starts the story.

1,"I recently read Douglas Adams' increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy in its entirety over a rather short period of time (not recommended, you'll have difficulty integrating your world with Adams').  Looking back, this first book was one of the more hilarious of the five.  It is characterized by Adams' traditional zany style of humor (prevalent in the first 3, not so much in the last 2).
The best part of this book is being introduced to the wonderful cast of characters that Adams has created, especially Arthur and Marvin.  If you have a sense of humor, they will make you laugh.  There's not much of a plot to speak of, which is the book's major weakness.  However, it is an appropriate setup to the rest of the series, and I would definitely advise everyone to at least read this initial installment before plunging into any of the other installments.
My advice:  read it.  Expect a classic, but don't expect the greatest that Adams has to offer (that, in my humble opinion, would be the fourth book, SLATFATF)."

There are a lot of secrets that she has to keep from the other teens.  Some of the kids are so scared and confused that they will never figure out who she is and will be the person she wants to be.  When her friend, a girl named Doris, gets kidnapped and gets taken away by the evil and evil group known as the ""Vampires"" and tries to figure out who she is, she is attacked by vampires.  Doris manages to get her friend away and helps her in hiding.  She is rescued by"

Kacey O'Donnell, Marine combat helicopter pilot, recently home from Afghanistan is visited by the love of her life, retired Navy SEAL, Nathan Weatherly. Nathan has come to the sleepy New Hampshire town when his former BFF lets him know that Kacey is in need of an intervention. Throw in a really great plot line about a kidnapped pre-teen who is also in need of help and the action gets good. So... if you can speed read through the smut, you may have a good read."

1,"These curtains are absolutely fabulous in my formal dining room. I got the crimson color and it's beautiful against my mustard yellow walls. I had been saving up money to buy fancy curtains but came across these and decided that, for the price, I couldn't go wrong. The length I wanted (91 inches) wasn't in stock so I got these longer, 108 inch ones. WOW- they look just like beautiful raw silk and they are such a beautiful color. The length wasn't even too bad but I decided to use some hem tape so they just break about 1-2 inches on the floor. They were wrinkly from being packaged up so I ironed them a little, which was very easy. I will definitely be buying more curtains like these in the future!"

1,"I know about flashlights.  Nothing in this review will be an exaggeration, honestly.  This light is not usable in any sense.  The output can only be described as dim.  Thats not a comparative statement.  The ""beam"" is orange and barely visible.  If you're looking at something small within 2ft of your face,  you can see it if you strain your eyes.  Negotiating the dark is impossible.  Ive honestly never seen a dimmer light in any size, and this one is alot larger

I have used it for many different things - it cut paper smoothly, right out of the box; I've peeled fruit & veggies with it; opened packages with it; widdled some twigs with it; cut wires; and even pried open a metal lid that was tightly seeled.

It's thumb release is wonderful and makes opening the knife quick and extremely easy. One-handed operation.

It's sturdy, looks good and has a substaintal pocket clip that holds the knife securely in place while not being difficult to remove when needed. It feels good in the hand and I've used it for about a half hour straight when peeling potatoes at one point without any fatigue.

Great item and I'm planning on getting a second as a spare (maybe for the car)."
1,"I really like the games by this company (Gamewright). They have a whole series of short easy to play games and this is one of them. My four year old has been able to play this because it is easy and short and is over before his attention span is over. My eight year old has enjoyed this game and others like it by this company.

I'm not sure how educational it is, but I will say that it does help younger children with visual discrimination which is a prereading skill. Because this is a card game it is somewhat prone to being destroyed by young hands. However, the cards are larger than normal playing cards and very sturdy.

I would not hesitate to buy this game again. Enjoy."

I had a similar model before and it worked perfectly, so it should work well with this model. It does not work with this model.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to install and works well. It's not hard to install, but it takes a little getting used to. It's not really a big deal because it's a small thing. I'm not a big fan of the price point and this thing does the job perfectly.

1,"I haven't used this yet but I am anticipating I will in the next few weeks. We were giving some antelope skins by someone so we my young son could practicing tanning and maybe make some moccasins from the skin. The first thing we noticed was that there was a lot of 'meat' on the skin still.

So we found out we needed some tools, this had good reviews and we purchased it. One thing you notice when handling it is that this is very sturdy with some weight on it. The edges are not dull either. While I don't believe they are the sharpest edge you could get, they feel like they could cut through some stuff. I am thinking we might sharpen the edges.

I believe having this tool in hand will be very helpful. I'll try to update after we have used it on our hides."

1,"My wife recently endured ""The Big C"" herself in real life and wanted to see this show, so I bought the first season for her to view.  Having gone through her ordeal with her (and thus being labeled a ""caretaker""...who really took care of whom?, is my question) I sat down and watched these DVDs with her.  This is a very entertaining series!  Bravo, ShowTime, for creating a great show!  However, this woman has problems.  She's in denial, she wants no one to help her, she doesn't want other people to know about her condition...the exact opposite of what my wife endured.  My wife let EVERYBODY know that she had cancer, and as a result friends and family came rushing to her aid; her support group meant everything to her and made her ordeal that much easier to handle.  Three years later she's not only a survivor, and meaner than ever at that (I'm proud to say that I'm back to getting my much deserved weekly beatings), but she's an advocate for other cancer patients who do not have the friends and family to support them in their time of need.  Perhaps the moral of this series is that no one can suffer the disease alone...everyone needs a support group...and by denying her condition to herself and others she's doing herself a disservice.  Watch this series if you want to know how NOT to act if you have the Big C...you'll not only learn a few lessons, you'll be entertained as well."

1,Fit just as nice as Lego brand.  Would buy this brand again.
1,The camera is amazing in every way except for that it has a noticeable shake on the outside edge when shooting in 4k mounted on a tripod. This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem. The truth is the issue isn't that bad and you have to 'notice it' and in all honestly the other features of the camera still make it my primary camera with anything I shoot for Barnacules Nerdgasm on YouTube.
1,"It felt fresh. With all this dark, creepy dystopia on the market today, here's a lighter dystopian book with just as much adventure, romance, and all-around awesomeness! It really didn't feel dystopian at all. There were still the big problems of war and incurable disease, but the characters still had hope, which made the biggest difference.

I LOVED all the characters! The good guys were good, the bad guys were bad, and the stepmother remained in the middle of the two. I don't want to say that they felt unrealistic, but they weren't completely realistic either. Except for Cinder, all the characters felt like they were slight caricatures of their true selves. This wasn't a bad thing, though. It just made it kind of easier to point out ""Oh, he's prince charming! And that's the evil person! Oh, and don't forget the fairy god-droid!""

I know everyone's been talking about that really predictable plot twist. Yeah--it was predictable. And knowing beforehand that there was a predictable twist like that meant that the first time it was even mentioned I totally figured it out.
Luckily, that didn't take away from the story at all! The plot never lost excitement, and kept me on my toes throughout it all!

I would recommend this book to ANYONE in a heartbeat! It's a fairy tale for the girly girls, with a strong willed cyborg heroine for the not-so-girly girls, and it's got robots and mind-controlling moon people for all the boys!"

1,"This is the most psychotic book ever written! The faint-hearted and easily sickened need not read this 'cause it'll do it for ya! Ok, so the beginning's a little slow--so what? This book rules!  The only bad thing about is the HUGE description of how Chyna's chained to the chair.  Vess is  definitely a very interesting character (if not completely terrifying) and  his job just makes everything even better!  Chyna's sort of stupid for  following him but that took serious guts and hey--it was a lot more  interesting than just calling the police and cowering in the corner til  they got there.  This book makes most other horror/suspense thrillers look  like nice, safe little fairy tales!  For the millionth time and as so many  others have said before me: Dean Koontz is da man!  Yeah, baby!"

This is a small radio so if you are looking for something with some power you will need to run the Aux out to some powered speakers, but at your desk or workstation it is great."
1,"I have an anxious dog.  His anxiety is not such that my Veterinarian has recommended ""serious"" drugs for management, but I do like to try out the over-the-counter offerings like this one with him.

The big downside of this nutraceutical is palatability... neither of my dogs liked the taste and would ""eat around it"" when it was in their food.  I could easily ""pill"" them with it, but that's a hassle and I don't think it's particularly helpful to force things on an already anxious dog.  They would not eat it even when it was combined with peanut butter or had cheese wrapped around.  They are, admittedly, kind of picky, but that made this product unsuitable for us.

The ingredients are
Active Ingredients (Per Tablet)
Chamomile - 150mg
Passionflower Powder - 100mg
GABA (Gamma Amino Butyric Acid) - 100mg
L-Theanine - 50mg
L-Tryptophan - 33mg
Thiamine (Mononitrate) - 4mg
Ginger Root Powder - 2.5mg
Inactive Ingredients Beef flavor, brewers yeast powder, liver powder, magnesium stearate, cellulose, silicon dioxide, stearic acid, thiamine mononitrate.

These are interesting and not ones I have seen combined before.  Theoretically, the L-tryptophan and L-theanine, in particular, could have calming effects, although the research jury is still out on everything from dose to actual efficacy.  I do think this comes under the heading of ""mostly harmless,"" although you should always check with your Vet about anything with which you plan to attempt to treat your pet long term.

This is certainly affordable, compared to a few of the other popular over-the-counter remedies.  Be aware that it is very common for it to take 6 weeks or longer before you see effects from any nutraceutical.  Cautions on this product indicate that it hasn't been proven safe for pregnant or lactating bitches, and that it should be discontinued 5 days before any general anesthesia is administered."

The characters do a lot of angsty things that I found annoying. Overall, it's just the sort of depressing movie about people you would have nothing to do with in real life. Why associate yourself with people who would be so self-destructive? It's the sort of movie that would probably have done better on TV, but not in a movie theater."

The case is very nicely crafted in cream colored leather with attention to detail from the padded top to the gently gathered rounded corners. The inside is a very light pink color. The upper removable tray dividers can be taken out so that it could hold necklaces.  The case was packaged inside fabric type sleeve and the clasp of the jewelry case was wrapped in tissue paper for protection. The case was put into another decorative box which in turn was tightly encased in the shipping box.  This was an excellent purchase as a very good price point.  It makes for a very nice gift.

1,"We have been so excited to test out our new kite since it arrived a few days ago.  The weather finally cooperated today, and we were able to take it out for a test run.  First of all, this kite came packaged exceptionally well.  The entire kite is very impressive and includes everything you need, complete with a stunning kite, string (with a dispenser), directions, a spare cross piece, spare connectors,and a spare tail.  The kite looks stunning in the air, and even after a few dips and falls is holding strong.  Best of all, if a piece like a cross piece breaks, we have a spare.

 After having bad luck with kites in the past, I was nervous about trying another kite, but I'm so glad we did.  Finally, a kite we can enjoy, store nicely, and lasts more than a few times.  This kite will last for a long time, and even comes with an exceptional guarantee, the ""Sea-'n'Tree NO-LOSS Guarantee"".  Funny, but amazing!  I am more than impressed with the durability of this kite, and would definitely recommend it.  It's prefect for children and adults.

Product was provided for a fair and honest evaluation."
1,"It's a fairly entertaining game.  It takes about 5 minutes to explain the rules, and about 30 to play.  The rules are simple and there is a little amount of hidden roles to keep people guessing.  The main mechanic of the game is chucking dice, in a very similar way to King of Tokyo.  4 stars because some character cards have more of an impact than others.  Also, we found that with 6 players, it is hard for the Sheriff/Deputy to win.  Outlaws almost always win (just because 3/6 of the players are Outlaws).

I recommend this game, but only if you don't like other games that fill this particular itch better.  I'm talking about a light game, easy rules, can hold a lot of people, hidden roles, and low downtime between turns.  There are other games that I think can fill this void better, such as One Night Ultimate Werewolf, or The Resistance, just to name a couple.  But if those games aren't for you, this game can be the filler for your group.  You will have fun playing it, but I think most people would prefer the games previously mentioned, especially if we're sticking to the hidden roles action mechanic in a game.

7/10 would recommend."

As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life.  That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth.  If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."

1,"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face."

1,"I used to be stuck on Kershaw and CRKT for folding knives, but once I started looking for ""larger"" folding knives - I had to turn elsewhere.

Enter Cold Steel. The Voyager is a GREAT heavy duty folder. I'll make this simple and quick - you get all the blade quality and blade size with NONE of the weight and the ridiculously large handles that some companies put out.

The Large Voyager gives you a solid 4"" blade of nicely crafted AUS-8 stainless steel. I used to hate knives with the lock on the back of the handles. Cold Steel has changed that. I now LOVE them, those tri-ad locks are the best! Tougher than old leather, but not impossible to manipulate. I can open and close my Voyager easily with one hand, but I'm not supremely confident when I have the blade locked into position and ready for a tough task. As much as I like my other folders, even the ones with good liner locks....I can't say the same of them for some tasks.

Another note on the handles - they have good texture. It's aggressive, but not bitingly so. Are they thin? Yes, but they're tough. They're also comfortable, having the right grooves in the right places, allowing you good purchase on the knife, regardless of your hand size, I'm thinking.

The Voyager, in whatever configuration you prefer, is the best large folding knife I've ever come across, and the price is quite reasonable. Buy one, you'll like it!"

It is a sweeping trip through many of the capitals of the Holy Lands and cradle of civilization.  It is also very sobering.  We are talking about a very rough ""neighborhood"" when we talk of the Middle East.  This book does a magnificent job of bringing these complicated disputes into brilliant focus.  It was the title of the book that caught me.  The content is what leads me to a FIVE STAR review.  Great writing from page one."

1,"I love period dramas, and I thought the the premise of the series, the start of the New South Wales penal colony towards the end of the eighteenth century would certainly be of interest. Shot on location in Australia, the series had excellent production values. The sets and costumes gave it an air of period authenticity. The acting was excellent. The convicts, men and women were suitably grubby.. So, what was the problem?

The scripts were simply sub-par. Melodramatic, with overlays of twenty first century social and sexual mores that effectively kill any authenticity of time and place, the writing is what finished off any chance of a second season. Not even the excellent acting could validate the almost ridiculous plotlines. Still, I derived some enjoyment from this series, if only because cause I have a soft spot for period dramas."

I believe if you had not read the first 2 novels in the series you would not really enjoy this final book - you would miss so much. Yes, Ms. Atwood does refer back to the other 2 books to explain, but there is just so much to connect to - as much of a feeling of the other 2 books, as just details

This 3rd novel is about the survivors of the waterless flood gathering together for strength against their common enemy,the Painballers. Toby and Zeb have the largest parts in this book. They take the most chances to save the remaining survivors and the Crakers (recombined DNA humanoids). Toby's nightly stories to the Crakers  are full of both sadness and humor  - because the Crakers are so peace-loving that they almost seem like small children.

This is not as action-packed as the other 2 novels - it is a winding down and a closing. I really enjoyed it though - especially Toby's comments and explanations to the Crakers  :)"

Grace Hart is many things. She is a cousin, a daughter and a fianc. She enjoys her job, is basking in auntie-hood and is eagerly planning to walk down the aisle with a man she adores. What could be the problem? On the surface, nothing, but as Grace shares her past and the often painful memories she has, it is easy to see the serene faade is hiding a lot of pain. Jonathan Waters, her fianc, is loving, supportive and ready to provide the understanding ear or pillar of strength that is needed to help Grace through the painful journey of discovery she is on. He is sexy, dominant and a perfect partner to his strong, yet vulnerable, fianc. The writing style is natural and flows easily. A few awkwardly worded sentences were surprising but did not detract from a strong story and characters I really enjoyed. I finished the book in one sitting and am looking forward to catching up on earlier books and rereading this story with all the background knowledge this time!"

The previous one had rubber gasket between upper and lower parts, this one has cheap plastic stuff which leaks when you pour the hot coffee. It is very unpleasant experience. Top portion of the maker has also deteriorated from the previous model. Hadn't I trashed the original box, I would have returned the maker after the very first use.

Ordered a rubber gasket to replace the original plastic one.

Update: the maker was returned as the quality of the product was below expectations. Rate was changed from 2 stars to 1. Not recommended for purchase."

1,"Get out your fans! Whew! You'll need it while reading this one!

Brainy lab scientist Laura Manning has got a two big problems 1) she has to present the findings of her lastest project to the broard in a little over one week and 2) that would be easier if she didn't have sexier-than-sin Jay Cutler as her lab partner, all added to the fact that someone is out to get their secret files on the project by any means. So exactly how are they going to test their 'pleasure control' drug without anyone finding out their results before they present them to the board? -on themselves of course! Laura thinks that this is all in the name of science, but Jay has other ideas and after the 'experiments' are over, he's thinking of a more permanent relationship. But, ""Wildman"" Jay Cutler has really got his work cut out for him because Laura has a hard time believing it's her that he wants and not because he was under the influence of the pleasure drugs.

This is a really good debut. A very hot book. If your looking for lots of  scorching hot love scenes in a contemporary then this one is for you.  But my biggest gripe is the length, which is a little over 200 hundred pages with large type. I think the author could have added another 100 pages easily (perhaps it's the fault of the editors?). It was just over too fast for me and the overall scenes could have been more descriptive. I did enjoy it though and I'll definitely be getting the sequel. There's lots of room for improvement, but I think that Fox has a good start.

A very good short and heavy-on-the-love-scenes contemporary read."

The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.

This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.  I just wish the manual did a little better job of indicating lubrication points.  Perhaps if it had a picture with arrows indicating spots to lubricate."

1,"This book is definitely not a ""bit of light reading for your spare time"", but it is very difficult to find a biological concept that they do not cover in this book.  This is the book we use in AP Bio.  What makes it difficult is the fact that there is so much chemistry, but that is by nature of the fact that you take chemistry the year after bio, not anything that has to do with the book.  This book makes biology fun and interesting.  It has detailed explainations of things and gives clear, colorful diagrams that are very useful.  You could use this book as a biology encyclopedia or use it to teach yourself any topic pertaining to bio.  I would really recommend at LEAST a year of high school chemistry before taking this class if you don't want to stress yourself out trying to learn the chemical topics they present to you.  Not that they don't do a good job, it can just be too much though."

Don't need to wrap the pans in baking strips because the pans are double insulated on all sides as well as the bottom, so everything bakes evenly.  I bake a lot including several wedding cakes and countless birthday cakes, everything homemade, and I swear by these pans.  Customer service is really great.  I had some a question and the customer service representative was so helpful and gave some great advice.  This company takes baking very seriously. Between the product, customer service, and the change they made to the sticky labels that come on the product (they come off much easier now), they have a devoted follower in me."
1,"I really enjoy the multiple story lines in this book. Nuts when you think the case has been solved you wonder what could possibly fill the remaining 150 or so pages.  Then you find out.  Harry Hole is his own toughest critic.  The tragic hero to whom we can all relate with his failures as spectacular as his successes.  Nesbo's story telling has steadily improved.  There is more flow and less confusion in the plot of this and the previous novel, The Snowman, which I also loved.  I have read all of the Harry Hole novels through this one and I am on to the next.

I am a big fan of ""Nordic Noir"" having read Larsson, Lars-Keppler, Adler-Olsen (except for his latest, The Marco Effect), and several of Indridason's Detective Erlendur novels:  Nesbo ranks high on the list."

Update: Did anyone ask for an update on this throw pillow? Who can know. But I wanted to say that this pillow is so scratchy that it is pretty much unusable and I'm probably going to get rid of it. I am angry at the pillow but in a larger sense I am angry at myself for letting me underestimate my
worth for so long? I don't need a scratchy pillow. I can live many good lives and have no need for the past."

1,"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

The story is well written and the story is very well told. The ending is satisfying and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.I loved this book.  It was very sweet, very emotional, and had a really nice ending.  I was just so happy that I got to read it.  I was a little confused at first, but I did like"
1,I had previously bought the white desk for my daughter and was happy with it. So I decided to order another one for my son. The red one that I received today is ridiculous. The entire thing looks like it's covered in a thin paper. There are faint brown lines on the legs that is peeling away as well as scratches. I'd return it if it wasn't such a hassle. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
1,"I am writing this for my two dogs. They say they really like them and want me to purchase more in future. They also like the fact that there is little chance that the chews will get stuck in their throats.

Is there anything else.........I guess not."
1,"This is such a cute little fake guitar.  It is push button rather than anything with real strings.  You play it by pushing the button where you would normally strum the guitar and you do ""fret"" work by pushing down on the interior of the fret section of the guitar.  There is a flip section that alternates the music between electric and acoustic.

My grandson is almost 18 months old and doesn't really know who Dora is as he watches very little on TV (and then only a couple of specific DVDs.)  We do, however, play a lot of instruments amongst the family - just in my house along there are over a dozen different instruments.  He even has a small ukelele of his own at his house that he plays with.  He grabbed the Dora guitar as soon as I showed it to him and showed him which buttons to push.  He ""played"" guitar all afternoon - carrying it around with him everywhere.  He would stop and start dancing and shaking his head to the tunes or would drop the guitar to clap - and then realize that he had to play it again to make the music continue.

The final move of the day was when he put it in his pop-up castle (along with his much beloved Fisher-Price piano keyboard) where it will wait until next week when he comes to my house again.  He loved it and played with it for hours.  His smile was so big, I wondered if it hurt his face to keep it up all afternoon. I'll probably pull out one of my guitars and then we can rock out together.

This is a really cute toy guitar and I recommend it highly.  I don't know why it is recommended for 3 years and up.  I don't see any small pieces that could be a hazard and my little guy loved it at 18 months."

0,"After hearing about this ""great"" movie, I jumped in and saw it for the first time.  It's not the best movie, but it is the best of the three.  The story is well told and the acting is outstanding.  If you like ""The Sixth Sense"" you'll like this one. "
1,"I have mixed feelings about this book.  At times I loved it; other times I threw it across the room.  The information on writing reviews, Listmania, and So You'd Like To...Guides was extremely valuable.  Knowing how Amazon uses this information to get more exposure for your book is worth the price of the book.

But there were a lot of questions that remained unanswered.  Author Connect was somewhat confusing.  I asked quite a few people to access an author's profile page and no one succeeded. Amazon customers will follow the path of least resistance. If these are so well hidden that Brent has to give you a web address to put in to find it, how are the readers supposed to uncover this ""useful"" information?  They won't.  I understand that isn't the Brent's fault, but why should I spend my time doing something potential buyers can't find, even if it's free!

Buy X Get Y could have been more detailed.  There is more to pairing books than selecting a title.  Is it worthwhile to pair your book with a top selling title that has a one or a two-star review as a Spotlight Review?  What if the title you select is in the top 10 in sales, but sells for 1/2 the price of yours?  Is it a good match?  I don't expect Brent to do all the work, but I do feel these are valid questions that should have been addressed.

If you look at most of the 5 star reviews, you will see that they are nothing more than shameless self-promotions of books written by the reviewers.  That should tell you something."
1,Bought this for my 1  year old daughter to go with her new kitchen for Christmas and she absolutely loves them!  We have bought Melissa & Doug products in the past and they are very well made and I would highly recommend them to anyone. I think its wonderful that there is a company who makes toys from wood and that are made with such good quality.  It seems like you just don't see that as much anymore.  I know they will keep my daughter busy and happy in her new kitchen for many years to come!

1,"I ordered these for a party.  I will not be re-ordering.

The image displayed is not the image of the item being sold.  These Ping Pong balls have 1 long continuous groove running in the center of the ball; the groove divides the sphere into two equal-sized semi-spheres.  The words ""Made in China"" are stamped in black ink on each ball.  They also don't bounce like normal Ping Pong balls.  This last issue would be a total deal-breaker if I had purchased these for Ping Pong.  But that is not what they were purchased for!  They served their purpose, and were inexpensive enough which is why they get 2 stars.  I won't be reordering, I'll just go to Dick's or other sporting goods store to pick them as needed.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision."

It was great.  I watched it with my kids.  They loved it.  It's very sad.  I have to say that I'm glad I watched it, because I was actually not expecting it to be a movie that would make me cry.  I mean, I could have bought a lot more of this movie, and I could have gotten it for less money.  It's just a movie."

Yes you can bridge them together to make one hell of a wall of light, just don't tighten them to hard its only plastic.

Order a second battery if you need to but I have run it for an hour only to have it work a week later for 20min still. It holds a chrage well."

1,"Surprisingly decent sleeping bag with a reasonable amount of room inside. Very compact when compressed, and light weight. Needs to be lofted each time before use (not hard to do). Loft is around 1-1/2"" with sewn through baffles. Probably good for upper 30's, low 40's Farenheit as a comfort temperature for most sleepers - I have not had a chance to test it at temps this low yet. Zippers are small and can catch the light outer fabric easily so use caution when zipping in. Stitching was good - no loose threads. No hood, but I knew that when purchasing. Good value at less than $100."

1,"I'm really impressed by this food, although before a month ago I never heard of the company. I always go to dogfoodadvisor.com before I consider feeding my two Anatolians any food. They rate the food and tell you everything that's in it and what those ingredients do to and for your pet. They didn't have this exact flavor available to read about( my understanding is that this is due to it being so new) but all the other lines, grain free and otherwise, by this company got 4.5-5 star recommendations which they don't give out lightly. I mixed this with an equal amount of my usual pet food so there was no tummy upset. Both dogs, one of which can be a picky brat, have eaten it with no qualms and some gusto. They aren't begging me for it but they aren't ignoring their food either. My only issue with this food is that it's more expensive than my usual food. You do need to pay for quality but you need value as well. Otherwise I would definitely get this again for my fur kids."

You need to trim the muzzle break area according to your needs Cutaway is for a loaded AK and there are two additional cutouts for magazines. I had to trim the foam for the buttstock for my Yugo M70. Didn't leave much protection for butt-plate but its rubberized and fit nicely. I just wish they slid the whole gun cut out a little to the left. Pleanty of room to.  I made a third cutouts for a third magazine and then enlarges the ""ammo"" cutout to hold all the goodies, oil, grease, cleaning kit, Not much room to add any additional magazines so get out your magazine bag.

1,"The Good Things
*Great photography style and quality.  Every scene is fascinating.
*Interesting group of characters, with lots of interesting and memorable moments.
*Good dialogue (and good monologues).
*Very interesting, broad view of the issue of drug addiction.  It accurately captures the good and evil of it.  It is a little thought-provoking.
*Has some funny parts and some sad dramatic parts.
*Excellent soundtrack.

The Bad Things
*A couple of really gross scenes (one involving the worst toilet in Scottland, and the other involving flying feces).
*Accents are intense, almost unbelievably so.
*Some extremely wierd parts.
*Pretty wierd plot.

Stylish and hip, this film is never dull.  It is filled with memorable scenes and dialogue.  The characters are mesmerizing.  At its core, this film approaches the issue of drug addiction objectively, revealing both the good and the bad that it perpetuates.  Altogether, it's a very interesting portrayal.  Anybody who is interested in this kind of material should check this out."
1,"I was looking for less expensive cookware than what NuWave had to offer and this was a great buy. Very reasonably priced. I do use the Barkeeps friend to handwash, not the dishwasher. I believe if you properly take care of your cookware it will simply last longer. Look really nice, exactly what I wanted. I did do some digging thru the other buyers complaints and some were exaggerated. The others were very helpful as far as care instruction. I recommend if you looking for induction ready cookware."
1,"Received this flashlight just before hurricane Matthew hit Florida.  Love it!!  Came with batteries installed so we could use right away. The adjustable head was so helpful, both to illuminate darker areas in kitchen for food prep, and also to use in the up position and it illuminated our entire great room ( 16 x 25 ft!)  Now by illuminate I don't mean everyone will be reading books by this light, although if you sat close you could - I mean that it was a soft illumination for the entire room.  I didn't remove the protective pad for the magnet so didn't use that feature.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Provided much more usable lighting than our traditional Stanley flashlight.  I had neighbors ask me why our house looked so lit up and I got to brag on this flashlight.  Hope they get more sales as it's so useful in a power outage, and heaven forbid you are in a dangerous situation it has a very strong clip to clip to your belt/jacket/whatever."

1,"ok ever since this whole walking dead phenomenon started my hubby has been on this survival gear kick for ""just in case"". I usually laugh at it, but it got me thinking, I have been in situations living around the world where I was stuck in the worlds worse typhoons and was without for a long time. It would have been nice to have some of this survival gear. And that made me think I do live in a area where natural disasters happen, you never know and you do want to be prepared. So when I came across these emergency thermal blankets, I thought perfect, it will go great in my emergency kits for the cars and the house. It comes in a pack of 10, which is so nice, because I have them in my emergency kit in the cars and the house. Each blanket comes individually wrapped in it's own ziploc type bag for easy storage. The bag is about 4 3/4"" x 3"" in size. Fully opened, the blanket measure approximately 81 1/4"" long x 51 1/2"" wide. These blankets are said to reserve/reflect about 90% of your body heat. They are also waterproof and weather proof. Hopefully I will never have to use them in an emergency, but it puts my mind at ease knowing I have them and that they work really well!!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I'm offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.

It is great for autos, steps, and bare floors, which is what i wanted; I use my canister for the wall to wall.  It is easy to empty the dirt container and because it is clear, it is easy to see when it is full.

1,"I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved."

Monica was just as adamant that witches and shifters had no business bonding together.  Her best friend can nag her all she wants but Monica wasn't going down that path.  No way!  Naturally, fate has a sense of humor and brings these two co-workers together one day at the office.  Neither is aware that the other is anything more than human.  Anticipation is delicious!  I held my breath waiting for the moment when Truth dawned on them.  After the reality ""hit the fan"", so to speak, then the story takes off at breakneck speed as they struggle with their feelings and who knew that a fight with a demon could clear the air so well.  Falling for the Bear is well written, beautiful and delightful.  I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.  Five stars."

Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

1,"The book description basically tells you everything that you need to know about the plot.

The writing is good, it kept me interested and I constantly found myself laughing at Katy and also thinking what a little idiot she was.  She takes defiance almost to the point of ridiculousness, without regard for her safety - or Cal's.  In fact she's pretty lucky that she doesn't end up raped or killed at more than one point in her life.

I don't really know if you could call this a romance though... there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of romantic feelings between the characters.  Affection and sexual attraction, sure, but it almost seems as though the main reason for their marriage is just that Katy doesn't want to go back home to her mother and step-father.  Not that she has a really good reason for that other than being upset that her father was replaced so quickly by a new man - and forget the fact that her mother probably NEEDED a man to help her run their large ranch (something that Cal points out that makes Katy feel bad for about 2.5 seconds).

But the spankings are well deserved and kinda fun, the plot is fairly enjoyable and there writing is well done.  The best part about the book, in my opinion, are Cal's telegrams to Katy's mother.  Seriously... made me laugh almost every time.  And not because he was being intentionally funny."

Because I didn't follow the Bee Gees as closely as I did the Beatles, I didn't really know that much about their history or much of their music. One thing I like about all of James' books, including this one, is the interesting tidbits of history that he includes - not only about the music and the bands, but about the time period in which they became popular."

1,"Dell laptops are not as evil as the 3 lower comments make them seem.  It takes some basic user knowledge to get accustomed with the product.  There is no need to 'knock' Dell down because of a bad user experience.

Blue screens are usually caused by bad programming or writing of software.  Blue screens have codes that say ""error: xxx""  where XXX is the name and code of the problem.  MOST bluescreens are MEMORY PARITY problems -- bad programming of software.

Dell not responding to customer issues is absurd.  I have never had that experience in the 15 years I've been contacting Dell for any situation.

My suggestion to people who have ""so much trouble"" is to figure out why others do not.  You may not realize that installing and uninstalling through the Windows installer is the proper way to install.  Installing through each individual programs installer is WRONG.  This advice will fix 9% of problems out there dealing with ""my laptop is slow now!"""

Mudd is a film that is the most emotional, heart-wrenching and heartbreaking film I have ever seen.  It is a film that is on the cusp of making a profound impact on the lives of people who are not only gay, but who are also people who are just as flawed and loved by their families.  This film is a film that can only be seen in the context of the lives of these people, and to them, and to the rest of us, as a film that has the power to change lives.

This film is a film that is about people's courage to stand up and speak out against violence and abuse.  It is a film that is about how people can make a difference, but also how they can live life without it.  This film is a film that is about the courage to be brave, and not just about the courage to be brave.

1,"Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!"

1,"The Garmin ""Bluecharts"" are vector charts, which means they use mathematic algorithms to store all the lines and features of a nautical chart.  I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.
The Garmin application the charts run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types.  I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit.
The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of charts from the CD-ROM.  I'm not sure, but I think it will only work with that specific unit, which worries me a bit as I am thinking about buying a second unit for backup."

1,"Like many other reviewers, I can confidently rate this tablet with at least 4 stars...provided you're a geek who is comfortable rooting your devices and installing new ROMs. As nearly anyone who has used this tablet will tell you, out of the box it's complete crap. How Viewsonic managed to so badly mangle the operating system is beyond me. But...spend just a couple minutes on the xda forums to find the instructions for how to root, spend another couple of minutes performing the root and ROM installation (and, for extra credit, install the Pershoot kernel), and you'll have a tablet that is lightening quick and capable.

I am currently running the latest VEGAn ROM (Gingerbread flavored) with the Pershoot kernel overclocked to 1.4 GHz. With a couple of battery-draining apks (applications) deleted, I'm still seeing amazing battery life and applications launch immediately.

A couple of notes if you're one of those people who has been slobbering after the latest ""fruity"" tablet... This ain't no iPad. But that's only because the Android OS is still transforming from it's caterpillar form into the beautiful butterfly it will become. You'll trade ""pretty"" for ""powerful"" since a rooted tablet like this one will give you full access to all of the amazing (and often experimental) apps in the Android Market.

Another ding: accessories. I picked up the USB keyboard/case for this device on amazon (for about $25) and love it. It adds amazing functionality with complete plug-and-play ability. But...that's about the *only* case you'll find for it besides the generic sleeves for 10"" tablets (I also got one of those).

I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the dreaded poor viewing angle for the screen often annoys me. It's true that you could potentially claim this is a ""privacy"" feature, but don't be fooled. I've often had to tweak the angle to get a comfortable non-eye-strain producing view of the screen for long periods.

Lastly, the front-facing camera (the only one) stinks. But, at a price half to a third of similar tablets on the market, I'm OK with that and the other limitations I mentioned."

Like when the units go to the field and the whole thing is cut short, it was a surprise, but the execution was forced and it seemed like a story rip-off.

I found that hard to do on my wireless network for some reason.  It doesn't necessarily do HD content, all that well though, but I think you have to get the more expensive one to do that. But it did allow me to hard wire my media center extenders to my network as well as my media center PC.  I have a much more secure connection now.  I do get speeds of about 40mbps most of the time, and I am reasonably satisfied with that since that is a pretty big jump in performance."

It's just terribly difficult to follow from one chapter to the next when the focus shifts from one character to the next.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's a bit of a pain to install.

I have a dog that is on a diet and a small dog so I have to be careful of my dog as they are too small for me.  I put this in a bag and it's a real good price.

1,I have had Drinkwells for years my cats and dog love them but after many years the cat one stopped .Thought I would try something different for a change.  - it has no fountain like the drinkwell .Maybe my fault for not realizing that . Water comes out over the dome . They and i  miss the fountain effect .It is very noisy if  you let water get low which is very easy with 4 cats . Their is no resovior option so if you have a few animals it does not last It has a tiny hole to fill the water . My cats do not seem to be thrilled with it  and go to the Bigdog Drinkwell now . I think if you are used to the drinkwell you may not like this . I will be buying them a drinkwell again . Yes it is a bit easier to clean and I like how it collects any debris but ...

Even better is that they were less than what the ski places sell googles for.  Since I liked my son's so much I decided to get my husband a new pair.  He has been using my uncles old googles for several years and it was time he have a new pair of his own.

He was so surprised when he received these.  He loves the blue face of the googles, it really makes them stand out.  The headband is adjustable so he was able to tighten them to fit him.  He can't wait to show off his new googles on the slopes this upcoming ski trip!"

I tried the Arris SB6141 (8x4) which worked well until it died.  So I decided to try something else and liked the idea of this 16x4 model.  However, once I replaced the Zoom, it would only achieve 55 Mb/s download.  I tried multiple power resets, but even though it bonded with 16 download channels I would peak about 55 Mb/s.  I put the very old Zoom (4x4) back in and it went back to 82Mb/s,  There are no configurable parameters.  I had expected at least the same performance and possibly better than the very old Zoom."

0,"As with everything, the rechargeable battery will last a long time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to install, so you have to drill down a little to get the batteries in. If you are going to use it for a lot of jobs, it will be a pain. I would recommend using the battery with a strong enough wire. I just put the wire in a little bit and it will be all right. I have no idea how to program it for a lot of jobs, but I'm not going to put it in a shop or garage.

Overall, I was very happy with this product. It is a very good product for the price. I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it at a good distance from your work area.

1,"I bought this doll for my 16 month old daughter who showed interest in giving her pacifier to another doll, so I figured we'd try this one out.  She seems to like 'feeding' the baby and watching her go to 'sleep' and we both like the fact that this doll has a feature that closes/opens the eyes depending on which way the bottle is 'fed'.  So far this doll has been a hit; it's soft body is fun to cuddle and carry, the eyes are cute and it's a good size, not too bulky.  We give this one an A+++"

Some of the holes weren't cut big enough, so they didn't even fit on the pegs.  The pegs don't fit well into the holes that were cut for them, so they fall out easily while the game is being played."

1,Tough and durable. Be sure to look yours over and make sure the enamel isn't chipped or doesn't completely cover everything. Im so happy I purchased this item. It's really heavy but cooks so well and is durable. I would recommend hand washing and only using wood utensils. It takes time to heat up and or cool down. If you overshoot your desired temp it will take time to cool down and this retains heat well. Would definitely purchase again.

My husband loves the look of it on me. I am very happy with this robe! The sleeves were rolled up and tacked in place but I removed the tacking. I like my sleeves long on these types of robes."

1,"I've become a collector, that's why I bought this. Do not buy this as a speed cube or first cube for someone because you think it ""looks cool"". It does. You see the inner workings. BUT...what's cool about this cube also happens to make it a nightmare to solve. In direct light, colors are difficult to spot. Very difficult. And as for mechanics, it's terrible compared to so many other brands. This is niche market--if you're like me, and became obsessed with cubes, and want to own one that's truly aesthetically pleasing, yeah, but it. But that's the only reason to."

1,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

1,"My dog has arthritis and Cushing disease, so she takes several medications three times each day.  Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.  It's a no brainer at my house; I've learned to put the pea/duck version on rotating order and hold my nose."

1,"This is a sweeping family saga set during the Dublin Easter uprising and the First World War. The Carmodys are a well to do Irish family living a charmed life in Dublin. Tragic events following the 1916 Easter uprising sees the family at odds with each other and forced to move to London.
Young firebrand Danny is supporting the cause of an independent Ireland. This puts him at odds with his brother Patrick who decides to join the Royal navy. Jenny his spoiled sister finds herself penniless and forced to look for work. Her Fiance John, once a promising prospect, is arrested for his involvement in the uprising and imprisoned.
This book is meticulously researched and contains many period details that bring the story alive. The working conditions for the women in the munitions factories and the horrors of the battlefield are a brutal back ground that helped me feel a great deal of compassion for the family.
I especially liked the character of Jenny as she undergoes a complete transformation. She starts of as a spoiled and selfish girl, but through hardship her eyes gradually open and we see her grow into a confident, independent and intelligent young woman. The story ends in 1917 and as this is titled book 1, I hope that Ms Petken is already busy writing the follow up. There are turbulent times ahead for Ireland and Im sure well see Danny involved. I look forwards to reading the follow up as this writer has a very engaging style and her research is solid."
1,"A first novel that reads and feels like a report from the field of a funny, sexy, ecstatic and fully lived life. Gallaway's book is about time, and
TRISTAN UND ISOLDE, and 9/11; the Velvet Underground, New Jersey, New York; 1870's, Paris, Washington Heights ... I could go on. The miracle is that from these disparate elements the author has formed a well-wrought urn that holds them all, that turns them into a Wagnerian elixir that that -- well, like TRISTAN -- is always eternal, and always modern, and crashes into you, hurling you through the air, if you let it, into your own extended love death --

It's indescribable, pretty much. Gallaway has the words, but he leaves you grasping for them. His book IS opera, and the joy of it is that you don't have to like opera to love THE METROPOLIS CASE. As I did."

1,"The Problem:
Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable."

1,"I got this for my Golden Retriever pup when she got spayed.  It fit the neck almost perfectly (she's at about 12 inches, so I got the medium).  It's very soft and pretty comfy.  It didn't bother her at all.

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

So if you have a larger breed, absolutely go a size (or more) higher."
0,"First off, this kit's only intended for the 1st year class.  There is a tiny one-piece set that the kid can put together and then put back together.  In other words, it is a simple set of stairs, a one-piece set that is easy to assemble, and a 2-piece set that is very difficult.  So it is a little challenging for older kids to put together, but it is pretty easy for younger kids to put together.  The kit comes with a few parts that the kids can use, but they don't actually put them together.  So it's a little more challenging for older kids to put together.  It is also a little harder for younger kids to put together.  It is also a little more challenging for younger kids to put together.  The pieces are very small, so it is a little harder for them to put together.  Overall, this is a very educational set that is a good value for a 5-year-old.

1,"The Mummy is a good example of a mediocre movie that is made interesting by the director's commentary on the DVD version.  In some ways the fact that it is not a very good movie makes the director's comments even more  fascinating, as we get explanations for what they were trying to do, and  some intriguing insights into the mind of a second-rate director.  Might be  worth buying if the DVD starts to disappear from rental shelves, which  eventually will happen."

It is huge but light so she can move it out from the wall during playtime and back when she is finished. She and her friends can both play with this because it is a two sided house with rooms on both sides. Fits Monster High furniture with room to spare but she also really loves the furniture it comes with. My only slight annoyance is if we want to change the floor plan it will be a very large pain. But I let her pick her favorite from the floor plans and we will be sticking to it and she is still tickled with it. Best gift of Christmas.

They still destroy them but it takes a while - like 3 weeks for that to happen.  I will stay with the real tough kong toys.  I don't recommend this toy to any dog that plays somewhat rough - it will not last.  Additional squeakers are a nice thought but they also present a hazard if they can be removed from the toy.  Overall not real impressed with this kong toy.

1,"Leigh finally has to face the fact that she does indeed have feelings for Ryan that go deeper than surface lust. But she's still a girl who does her best to stay rooted in reality, and without concrete answers about where Ryan came from, it's difficult for Leigh to let go and fully trust the man who has her heart.

I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of More Than Words. What struck me most is that this conclusion is a delightful mix of the distinct mythology that played out in Unchained Melody and the charming elements of Contemporary Romance that went into Turn The Page. Add in some intensely heated bedroom scenes and seriously swoon-worthy actions by Mr. Weaver, and you've got a conclusion with some bite.

All of the events from the first two books come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotions and have to confront many truths about his past.

If you're on the hunt for something that feels both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K. Munt delivers another memorable book hunk that rivals Tristan from her well-known Fairytail Saga. This is the kind of romance that should be accompanied by a folding fan."

A good review is needed in order to give us a better understanding of the story.  I will say this.  The story is based on a true story of a man who went into the hospital and died after being attacked by a group of people.  His mother, who lived in the hospital and was very ill, went to see him.  He was attacked by a group of people and was later taken to a hospital.  He was then treated and eventually released.  He was a well-known personality and he was released.

1,"The lights arrived quickly and, once we had enough sun, one of them worked great. To be fair, it has been cloudy and raining a lot lately and our house is surrounded by 80 foot oak trees that are several hundred years old so those trees also limit the light that reaches the solar cells that power this light.  The one light that worked great was the only one in a position to get enough sunlight. The rest were in shade all day and never came on. I'm going to move them around looking for a spot that gets enough sunlight."
1,"The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I have not used the AAA Lacrosse batteries that came with the unit."

1,"Even if someone gives you The Swede for free, it's not worth your time.  The book comes highly recommended, and it's a Scandinavian thriller, so I was ready to enjoy reading it from beginning to end.  Unfortunately, the plot is poorly constructed and impossible to believe (even for a summer book), and the one-dimensional characters made it a real struggle just to finish.  (To be fair, Ben - the gay lover, is interesting.)

The anti-American tone didn't bother me, but the lack of subtlety or cleverness certainly did.  Here's a sample sentence:  ""Like other Americans, he jingled coins in his pocket and constantly asked for more ice in his drinks.""  Shouldn't the author (or translator) have used ""some"" or ""many"" instead of ""other?""  Is it really possible that every American fits this description?

But that's far less important than the bad plot and characters.  Take my advice, and skip this one."

1,"I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller."

1,"Psychologist Daniel Hughes has done it again with his newest book, Attachment-Focused Parenting. In his highly-skilled and talented manner, Hughes has managed to take the complex terms and concepts of attachment theory and make it accessible for the reader. Hughes helps us to better appreciate that the parent-child relationship is a two-way interaction, with each being greatly influenced and affected by the other. Of equal importance, he helps the reader to see that parenting goes way beyond guidance and discipline; rather, both parent and child require a context for understanding what happens between them, and each is influenced by their own history.

Hughes relies extensively upon examples and real-life scenarios as he makes his points. In doing so, he appeals to a wide spectrum of parents. That is, he cites the example of a four-year-old who screams with frustration, while later addressing the parent-child struggles of a 16-year-old. Independent of age, however, the concepts Hughes lays out are universal for all children, regardless of age.

Get ready, though, as Hughes reminds us that the parent's own attachment history greatly affects the parent-child relationship. This certainly isn't new, as how often have we caught ourselves saying, ""I never thought I would say/do what my father/mother did..."" Without writing a self-help book for parents, Hughes proposes some questions and concepts parents should ask themselves about their own history, given the part it plays in raising their kids.

As a child psychologist who primarily works with foster and adopted children and their families, I continually deal with kids who have their own attachment issues to work through. While a professional can assist a child in this regard, much of the work to be done centers on the child's relationship with her parent, be it foster, adoptive, or birth. Because of this, Hughes' book will be at the top of my reference list for the parents I work with, but also for other professionals."

1,"I love the look and comfort of this jacket.  It's nice and warm and I like how I can change it up - hood with fur, no hood, no fur on trim, etc.

I am 5' 10"" 135# and have broader shoulders.  I ordered the medium and it is a bit snug across the shoulders, but still allows for some movement.  However, I probably won't be able to wear any thick sweaters underneath. The arm length is perfect (some medium jackets are short in the arms for me).  I think a large would've looked too big everywhere else.  I like that you can tighten the cord around the waist - to give you some definition of your waist.  The color is a unique, rich looking green tint - my monitor showed a true representation of the color."
1,"I really was disappointed when I received this.  It had white/gray spots on the inside.  Not sure what it was, but it looked a little moldy.  I used professional mold remover and a mold shield ( Zep Brand ) and treated it heavy for 2 days to make sure whatever it was is gone, and won't come back.  This fits perfectly in my Chevy Avalanche's Saddle bag, and hold's all my ropes, tie-downs and bungee's great!"
1,"READ THIS BOOK!!!

I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. He was required to read this book for a college economics class. I absolutly fell in love with this book. I do not read much, so an 1100 page book is a big undertaking for me. I will pass on what my friend told me:  The first 200 pages will seem slow because of the character discriptions and history. Give it those 200 pages and you will be hooked and it will read a lot faster. It is amazing that one person could compile everything that is in this book. What a work of art. As a reader, you will definetly start looking at the issues surrounding you in a different light. Only negative:  ""The Speach"" at the end of the book. It's way too long winded and over the head. Suggestion:  Listen to this speach on youtube to help get through it."

1,"This book is absolutely amazing. I love all the characters. I love Mason and Cora's chemistry. I also like Knox even though he is definitely up to something, can't wait to read more in this series to find out what happens. There are ghosts, vampires and witches and it keeps you wondering what's going to happen up to the end. Even the ending keeps you in suspense for the next book. Definitely worth buying and reading."
1,"Good book!!! Snipers are definitely an important asset to the military. But I was frustrated by what the book represented. The stupidity of the insurgents, the politics being played in Washington regarding the military, and the egos in the military with regard to helping each other in the time of war.  But it is important to note the people in the trenches were there for a purpose they believed in and were there to cover each others back. The book was an eye opener about the general state of our world and what goes on. Not very promising future for our children.  I really appreciated the sacrifice of Chris's wife and kids, and I also appreciated the work Chris continued to do for our veterans after he got out of the military."

1,Watched insidious chapter 2 the other night and I enjoyed it. If you liked the first one you will probably enjoy the follow up. The movie picks up pretty much after the events of the first film. And the Lambert family now have their son back and are trying to get back to normal family life. But as the movie goes on they can tell that something is off about Mr. Lambert played by Patrick Wilson. He just is not the same after saving his son from the other side following the events of the first film. Loved how they tied everything together in the sequel and I would definitely watch this again. Check it out.

1,"As many other people have reported, the vinyl is nice and heavy and very white. 9' x 20' is a great size for my studio.
I did run into 2 things that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using. I have one of these 3 roll wall racks and the roll fittings for it are too big to fit into the core of the vinyl roll. So I had to re-roll the vinyl onto a cardboard core from a previous roll of seamless paper."

This book is worth more than 5 stars. Its absolutely amazing. This is my first book by this author. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The depth of this story is absolutely brilliant. I stayed up late just to finish this story. Its so sad what you go through with a devastating tornado. This is the first story I read about the after effects of the tornado. The way this author wrote about the tornado and the after effects was amazing.
The character breakdown
Jersey Cameron goes through alot in this story. She is such a brave person, at times you don't know how she overcomes some of what she does. But she does overcome alot and it captivates you. Jersey Cameron is brave and sweet, but she can be so mean when she needs to be. I loved her character.
Jersey's mom and Marin. Jersey's mom claims to be something she isnt. She seems brave but she isn't at all. I didn't really like her character. Marin is Jerseys half sister and she is the sweetest cutest little girl. I enjoyed her character.
Ronnie after the tornado was just a waste he was not brave at all. He didn't do as well as Jersey did and I just didn't like him.
Jersey didn't really know her mom like she thought. But what she finds out. It takes so much for her to believe it.
Everybody should read this story. It opens your eyes to what could really happen in a tornado. Its emotional on every level. Very Powerful. Riveting. Just absolutely AMAZING. I loved every second of this book.

It is well made and the dogs love it. I have two 4 lb. dogs and one of them is a very picky eater. I had to give it to a friend who is a picky eater. She has a dog that is on a diet and a hard time eating her food. I wanted to give this product a try because I know that my dog will not eat her food and I am hoping that it will help her because it has the right ingredients. It is a very good product for dogs and I would recommend it to others. I would also recommend it for anyone who has a picky eater. It is very easy to put together and is easy to assemble.

The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable. The only complaint I have is that it is very heavy and hard to carry. I also have a very heavy blade with a very sharp edge and it is difficult to get the knife out of the sheath. I hope the knife is a good value for the money. This is a very good quality, and very well made. The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot use it as a gun, but it does work as a handgun. I would recommend it for a gun like a Ruger or M&P-15. I have used this for years. I bought the first one for my wife and she loves it. She is a 5'6"" woman and the other one for her daughter."

1,"Liz and Landon have been together the better part of 4 years. She refers to them as peas and carrots. They go well together, but there is not a lot of excitement. They are busy, sometimes ships in the night.

Then suddenly, they are laying it on the line and he proposes. The excitement is back and it it makes Liz want to find a way to keep it! She wants to be strawberries and whip cream instead of peas and carrots. And they have it, at least for now.

The she says to him how about we wait until our wedding night? The bet is on. Whoever does not give in gets the honeymoon they have dreamed of. Liz is pleased even though she wants to jump Landon. Then they are busy trying to pay for the wedding, survive the in-laws, and not get evicted.

Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.

I have to say I cannot wait for the next installment in the All About Love series. The author has really brought her A game to these books, so be prepared to enjoy with plenty of chocolate and tissues.

1,"Marion Myles has an incredible talent for drawing raw emotion from the reader and giving an almost preternatural insight into the emotional state of her characters, to the point that you as the reader are living those emotions.  Mental illness is a terrible and sad fact of life, and the ripple effects on the people around someone who suffers from a mental illness can be devastating in the extreme.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone who cares enough to try to make a difference, but Annabelle is fortunate to have a group surrounding her that love her and will do whatever needs to be done, physically, mentally and emotionally to help her fight her demon Anorexia Nervosa.  Falling in love is not something Annabelle thought would ever happen to her, while the 'Harpy' in her head constantly reinforced her feelings of worthlessness, but Alex fought for Belle and fought alongside her to defeat her disease and together they found an enduring love tempered in fire."

The light for the radio station is a little dim and in the sun it was hard to tell it was on.  For phone calls I honestly couldn't tell if the sound was coming out of my phone or the stereo until I hit mute on my stereo.  It was very hard to hear.  I tried several different calls and it was not working well but when I hung up and the music came back on nice volume.  It would have been fewer stars had I care about the call part of it.  I got this for my husband's car for road trips as his does not have aux or bluetooth and sometimes you can't get a station in or whatever reason and you want to hear music through the stereo speakers rather than the cell.  So for my purposes it is great.

1,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."

1,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.

The price of these shoes was outstanding!"

The iPad mini is no longer usable because it has stopped working. It is now a full-size iPad and does not have any special features like the ability to take a photo or a web browser. This little thing is very useful for taking pictures of flowers. It is not waterproof, but it does not have the same screen as the old version. The picture is not very clear and there is no way to see the name or date of the photo. The picture does not have a very good picture quality, and I find that the picture is very grainy.

It is a good movie, and one I would watch again.The series was great and a great family movie. I did not know about the ending, but I was really happy. I just watched it with my kids and it was great. I like that the main characters have grown up. I would recommend this series to anyone.I love this series. I love the acting, and the writing. It is definitely a must have for any fan of the series.I love the movie. I have watched it a few times and loved it so much. It's a great movie. My 3 year old loves it. I have no problems with this movie. I love the fact that it was filmed in the late 60s and early 70s. It was a lot of fun to watch and there is no other way to describe it. I recommend it to all the parents out there.This was a very good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who loves mystery movies.  If you like mystery movies then this is for you.  I would recommend this movie to everyone."

0,"I struggle with shoes and this is the only one I've tried.

The sizing is accurate.  The material is nice, but the heel is a bit wide.  The shoe is a little tight on my feet, but they aren't as wide as some of the other products I've tried.

I'm also a size 10 and ordered a medium.  They are a bit tight on me, but I think that they will be comfortable.

1,"Love Belvin has quickly earned a spot on my list of favorite authors. I can safely say I will read whatever she put out.

I think I might have been frustrated by the series if I read it as it was released, because each of the first books stopped very abruptly. Luckily, I didn't get put onto these books until all four were released.

I also must applaud the author of providing quality length novels. These were no novellas.

As for the actual content and presentation. Literally the only odd thing was the use of random thesaurus words that don't show up with frequency in the English language. I could guess their meanings from context clues, but I did find myself looking up a few definitions in each book.

The characterization of the main and support characters, and the development of the plot was flawless! The character's had enough of a history for them to be real, and they went through the right amount of hardships in moving toward commitment. She beautifully crafted an alpha warrior, while also allowing him to have a certain level of love and adoration of his woman. The way the characters grew to know themselves was wonderful to watch and resonated with the reader.

Well worth the read."

1,"Lighting can set the mood, whether you want a relaxing atmosphere or and exciting one, lighting can be used to create it. I received the Ohuhu Ocean Wave LED Light Projector and Speaker to review and it is wild!
This is more than an average light changing lamp. A small disc over the 12 LED lights moves while projecting the light through the 5 1/4 inch rippled lens, creating wonderful, ever-changing waves across the ceiling, wall or any surface it is aimed towards.
The patterns and colors are mesmerizing! The push of a button takes you to the next color. There are 8 different color patterns taking you from a multi pattern to red, to blue to green. Pick one that fits you mood.
This lighted orb also contains a speaker and an input to plug in your mp3 player, computer, your phone, etc so you can enjoy your music at the same time.
The projector can be operated off a wall outlet via the included outlet adapter or it can be operated off a USB device. You can take this almost anywhere to enjoy the hypnotic waves of color. It automatically turns off after an hour. I do wish there was a switch to deactivate the auto off for times when you want it to stay on longer. It's not that big of a deal to push the button to turn it back on though.
I love just turning off the light and having this cast waves over the ceiling and walls while watching TV or working on the computer. It gives me a tranquil feeling that calms me and lets my mind relax a little.
This lamp is great in the living room, bedroom or even a kid's room. You can experience the tranquil waves of color from the Ocean Waves Projector by scooting over to Amazon. Flood your room with color!"

1,"Took this hunting last year in the back country to save weight.  The bag is tough to use in shallow water.  The source water was dirty and even after back flushes it was slow to filter.  It probably took me an hour to get a liter and I was squeezing really hard.  Bag did hold up well for me.

I think this would make a decent emergency filter or as a backup but as others have said, it's not a higher volume filter for multiple day trips.  I'll be using my pump filter to fill bladders from now on.

I honestly can't see how this filter is rated high by so many people.  If you used the straw, your cheeks would be tired before you ever got a belly full of water."

Considering another for my chair.  It is just about an inch below the top of the chair's arm.  Makes it nearly perfect.  The shelf below works great for holding the boots after they come off for the night.  It went together easily, didn't have any trouble with the bottom shelf as others have reported.

When I first removed the lid, I found it had already spurted out some paint (likely during shipping). I made sure the spray tip was clean and unclogged, but the spray came out all spattery and uneven (I have a very good finesse for spraying paint from a rattle can, and this can just sprayed really badly). Now that it is set up, with a full two coats and two days of dry time at optimal temperature, the paint still scuffs with the slightest provocation. Even a soft paper towel scuffed the paint. This is a primer/paint combo, but I still prepped my surface with a good sanding and cleaning. This paint just doesn't have the quality I have come to expect from Krylon."

1,"Great bed. Purchased 48x30 in gray for 3 month old German Shepherd to accommodate growth size. Very inexpensive compared to local pet stores. Puppy/ dog should not be left unattended. Tendency to chew( similar to soft plush dog toys). I allowed him time to become familiar with the bed before placing into crate. In my opinion, this helps me correct him to not bite on the bed. After a lot of practice runs and patience, it is now inside the crate & intact. He enjoys lounging on it and even observes patiently while I vacuum the bed. Any dry out liquids can be easily sponged off. I usually let his saliva dry, comb it out with his grooming brush to loosen, and vacuum. This gray bed does not shed. No bed sheddings on the tile floor or on my Gsd puppy."

I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald."

The zip on lunch bag is a great idea for those of us who look like Hannibal crossing the Alps when we go to work. The lunch bag is big enough for a cold pack and my modest lunch. It might make the load ungainly if you overload the lunch bag.

Not a lot of bells and whistles here otherwise; there is a side pocket for a water bottle. This pack is a little small for day to day commuting for me but will get a lot of weekend use.

By Clint Evans and E. Calvin Barber 11

Hip Chick Publishing  2012

Nutritional and fitness experts, Clint Evans and E. Calvin Barber 11, write an easy to read book on the steps needed to improve health and lose unsightly and dangerous pounds by simple changes in diet and exercise. Many diet and exercise books abound, but this book is exceptionally user-friendly, backed up with medical and scientific research and is easy to conform to -- resulting in stunning changes to overall health, wellness and fitness.

Clint explains which foods sabotage both your health and weight loss, explains what certain foods do to harm the body and how to make choices that will maintain good health -- not to mention creating a body that looks  . . . hot.

Clint believes that an improper diet and intake of fast food, prepared food with dangerous additives, as well as foods containing hormones, pesticides and antibiotics, may well cause many of the modern diseases plaguing our country today. As co-founders of Hip Chick Fitness, Calvin and Clint tackle both "" the devastating downtrend in health . . . and the alarming surge in the obesity trend"". When following the guidelines of "" Get Down to 150,"" people may both prevent and/or improve upon diseases like diabetes, food allergies, cancer and heart disease, just to name a few. Calvin tackles the importance of the right type of exercise by presenting a routine that is simple, short and effective for both cardio and strength building.

This book is an important asset to not only just looking good, but feeling good as well. Their solutions are ""long-term, sustainable, and affordable"". The only thing the reader has to lose by reading this book is unwanted pounds.

I received this item as a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I will be purchasing another one.This item works great.  I am very happy with it.This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for smaller jobs. I'm not sure how long it will last but it does have a long life. A couple of years ago I bought one to use on a workbench for my garage. I don't know if it would be worth the money but it is a good tool.Works great.  I have used it for about a year and it still works.  I bought one for my wife and I thought it was good quality.  She is now very happy with it.  I am happy to have it with me.I bought this to replace a metal screw driver that was very hard to remove.  I would not buy this again.  It was not a good product at all.  I returned it.  I am now using it for a small project on a garage door.  The plastic driver is very sturdy and looks great.

I did get a size 10 and it fit perfectly.  I will say that I had to use a size 8 to get it on.  I wear a medium in shoes and I got a size 10.  I really like the fit of this shoe.  I'm glad I got a size 10.  It fits perfectly and looks great.  I am very pleased with this purchase and will definitely be purchasing another pair in the future.Very nice shirt. Very nice.

The front pocket is perfect for the wallet, so it's easy to carry and it's convenient to carry your cards, credit cards, and other stuff.  The wallet is a bit smaller than I expected it to be, but the pockets are a little longer than I expected.  This wallet is a nice wallet for the price, and I like it so much that I have bought another one for my husband.  I'm very pleased with this wallet!

Overall, it's a nice wallet.  It's not too big, but it's not too small either.  It's a nice thin wallet for the price.  It's also a good quality.  It's not the best looking wallet, but I like it.  It's not really a bad wallet, but I'm not sure I would use it for anything other than driving.  It's a nice wallet.

I'm always looking for more of a good looking wallet than a cheap one.  I'm always looking for the best wallet that is comfortable to wear with all my other shoes.  I don't care for cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap and cheap.  This is the only one that I can wear all day with no problems.  It's still a nice wallet and a good value.Very comfortable.

Picked this up on a trial basis just based on price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Took a bunch of pics in and around the pool and the quality was great.  It's really slow to recycle between shots but all pics were in focus and the colors wonderful.  Love that it has an auto white balance setting for underwater and I don't have to mess with filters.

1,"The Project Mc2 Soda Pop Science Kit comes with a kit to make your own fizzy soda.

You can make:

Lime Soda
Cinnamon Soda (didnt taste this!)
Fruit Punch

Kit includes:
Critic Acid
Baking Soda
Flavor packages
Test Tubes
Stand for the test tubes
Measuring Scoops
Instruction Booklet

This is a fun kit for kids. They market the MC2 line to promote science to girls and I appreciate that. I don't know if I was that hip on making soda - but we gave it a try.

The instructions are easy to follow, you add a few ingredients and make a drink. It really wasn't that hard. It was cool that you could have these things lying around and make your own later and they get the concept of household DIY stuff - that would normally be packaged and sold.

1,"Well this was excellent. I thought this was the best book in the series, and highly enjoyable. John's inner voice remains sarcastic and witty without verging into obnoxious or annoying, which many first person male UF POVs tend to do (looking at you, Harry Dresden).

Pros:
- John and Sig's relationship.  She's a total badass, and they have great chemistry and complement each other very well. Points also granted for Sig being allowed to do things that matter throughout the book, which makes her another actor who has agency in the plot instead of just the hero's blonde buxom action lovetoy.
- The introduction of elements of Japanese mythology and characters was nicely done.
- John is no Big Dicked He Man Who Must Protect Mate! Well, not any more at least. It's refreshing to see him able to keep those instincts in check.
- Supporting characters remain excellent, from Ted and Molly to newcomers like Sarah and the Kitsune whose name I could not remember with a gun to my head.
- The first rule of Fight Club is...
- John's family is known for rescuing virgins.
- Jim Butcher, this is how you pull off a heist plot, not whatever nonsense was in Skin Game. It's multiple concurrent moving parts that come together to form a beautiful whole, not ""Obstacle-Obstacle-Obstacle-Boss Fight!"".

Cons:
- Well, I read the blurb for book 4 that wa. So first off is the wait for the next book, whenever it will be. The second con is, if you fridge Sig because John's being too happy, then I'm taking all of this back, Mr. James."

My son in law really wanted to see this, so I rented it, and was pleasantly surprised. There were a few hokey bits (Batman doesn't kill Superman because their mothers had the same name?) but overall it was enjoyable, had a decent plot, and good action scenes. This is high praise from one who couldn't watch all of the last Superman movie. DC may do better in their ensemble pieces, like Suicide Squad or the Justice League. The teasers for the JLA looked pretty good, and Gal Gadot made a kick ass Wonder Woman, who enjoyed the fight.

I hope the next book is a little more developed and the story line is a little longer. I will definitely be looking for more of this author's work.I love this series and can't wait to read the next one.  The characters are well written and have great chemistry.  The writing is excellent and the plot is complex.  I look forward to reading more of the series.I'm not a big fan of this book, but it's a good story.  I was glad to see it ended.

1,"These trains arrived promptly all in a tiny see thru plastic zip top bag. They are slightly larger than the trains that came with my Mexican train domino set, but just barely. I purchased these when my teenager lost 6 of the 8 trains we had and we had only played a handful of times. I waited for months hoping the trains would show up. Low and behold within days of buying these trains she found the lost trains. Figures, right?

Now we have a lovely selection of the solid colored trains that came with our game and several more to choose from!  Solid, clear colored ones and some with glitter, something to appeal to everyone. I didn't think the train colors were ugly at all as some reviewers said. And if you should get an ""ugly"" color in your batch just think of it like the most unplayed token in Monopoly, it's really not the end of the world. They are sturdy little trains and are very similar to the ones that came with our game, no complaints here. *would like to include a picture but on my mobile I'm unable to do so,  I'll try again soon."
1,"I'm not a huge F1 fan but was curious about the use of multi-angle features on this disk.  Was really expecting an ""in your face"" in-car driver perspective, with extended racing sequences....disappointed with final product.  Very fragmented, difficult to follow, repetitive highlights, in-car clips too short too enjoy, pointless selectable race stats etc.  Overall, they blew it! It could have been a great DVD if they had designed it to be a seamless experience for the fan!  As it is, consider it a novelty disk, and of interest only to diehard F1 fans...If you want racing action checkout Super Speedway or Driven instead!"
0,"I had and constantly used this tool, and it worked flawlessly. The only downside is that it's very hard to get a good grip on the handle. The handle is straight, and it's not really stiff enough to hold a finger. This is a problem for most people. The only real flaw is that the grip is too loose. I've had this tool for a few years now and it's still strong. However, I would not recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a sturdy, secure, and comfortable hand grip. I'm glad I found this tool, because it was a pleasure to use. The company I work for should have started to make better tools. This is a great tool for getting things done at home. It's sturdy, holds a great angle, and is a good value. I don't recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a good quality tool. I really like the quality of this knife. It's sharp and very well made. I don't like the way the blade is curved, but it's a nice knife for my needs. The blade is made of metal, which means it's not sharpened like a regular blade. The knife is sharp enough to be used in a pinch, but that's okay because it's not meant for everyday use. The blade is sharp enough to be used for several projects, but I would not recommend it for a heavy project like this."

1,"I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.  If that changes, I will update my review.  Now the only thing remaining is the longevity of this device.  It looks built to last, so I hope it is.  This is a great product."

1,"I am so glad I picked this up on Kindle Unlimited. The lead female, Avery, is mostly strong and determined to make it on her own, if a bit naive when it comes to her ""best friend"". The lead male, Chase Winters. WOW!!!  He's the MMA heavyweight champion, capable of inflicting serious damage. His strength of character is as strong as his muscle. When Chase witnesses a heated discussion between Avery and another MMA fighter who wants to be more than friends and sees Avery get pushed against the concrete wall so hard you can hear her head hit it from over 10 feet away, Chase intervenes, telling the guy point blank YOU NEVER HIT A WOMAN. After the threat to Avery is removed, Chase watches over and tends to Avery, ensuring she gets the care she needs. Deciding this girl is the one for him, Chase proceeds to give his heart by absolutely cherishing Avery at every turn. He cares for her, he protects her, he respects her. This is a guy who knows how to be the alpha male without being over-the-top possessive and controlling. Chase Winters is all that and then some. It helps that Chase has a good friend watching his back (Dale) and a GREAT relationship with a TERRIFIC father. Their presence story really helps develop insight into how Chase became such a good guy. especially that of his father. What a great role model. You'll love him, too. I will definitely be looking for more from this author. This is an easy read and a sweet (Sweet) story."

1,"This is another great Jess Williams novel. Jess is a bounty hunter in the old west. He only takes the worst cases. In this novel he hunts down the Hombre and his gang of killers. They ride into a town and rape and pillage and kill everyone except one person. They leave one witness. Jess takes on the gang two or three at a time and wipes out the entire gang in the process. If you love a good western, you really should read this Jess Williams series."
1,"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that."

1,"UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy."

This has stood up to me so far and I've been wearing them both a lot this cold winter.  Often more expensive clothes I buy look like hell after one wear and one wash.  I was also pleased with the sizing.  For the price, how can you go wrong?"
1,"Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read."

I have never read any of Mindy's work before but I look forward to reading more of her books. The faith she puts in this story is heart changing.
Joel Miller is out looking for his family's dog, Shadow. Joel's daughter Sadie had disappeared four months ago and his family is grieving the loss. Now her dog had taken off, probably trying to find her. Joel finally goes to the one place he never wanted to go to again, Daybreak Pond, Sadie's favorite place. His heart breaks as he sees the evidence of her love of this place but he sees sign that the dog could have been there so he set out to find a way to get the dog to come to him.
This is a story of a man and his family grieving the loss of a child. How to deal with their grief and how to deal with a God that they think took her from them. It's a heartwarming story of find God in the midst of a storm and giving Him your trust in the midst of your struggle. God has a plan and you will love it if you give Him the right to move in your mess."

1,"These along with a wide-mouth jar coffee filter have stepped my coldbrew game to a new level.  We prefer lattes generally, so I'll brew a bottle and split the coffee between two mason jars, then add milk & sweetener to taste.  Pour top goes on then in the fridge, ready & waiting to caffeinate our bleary brains long before things like brewing or pouring milk make any sense to a sleep-addled, decaffeinated mind.

Seal on these is decent, though I still keep my finger over the flip top when shaking.  Only complaint is that the flip top likes to flip closed while pouring if you don't hold it open."
1,"This thing is awesome! I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more.
I would shop around a little more if portability is a major selling point for you, but on all other points I urge you to get this unit. It is a delightful tonal surprise at this price and I'm thrilled with my purchase."

The dog was a little too strong for this bedding, so I bought a large, bedding that would hold up to the heat. It was a great buy, and it has held up to the heat well. I also use it on my dogs when I'm away from the house, because it's easier to carry around than the other ones I've used. The material is nice and thick, so I feel it's a great value. I would definitely recommend this bedding. I'm not a fan of the cover on the back, but it's nice and thick, and my dog is comfortable with it. I wish it had the cover on the top, but I'm glad I didn't."

1,"I own a bunch of CK dress shirts and know the brand for making quality shirts that hold up to years of use. This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another."

I think its a great toy with a great opportunity to learn what is essentially a basic programming lesson. You are programming this little guy by configuring his parts. It is a really cool idea, and the fact that you can get additional parts is even cooler. He makes great sounds and is lively. I recommend for a fun, programming oriented toy for a kid 3+."
1,"I have three dogs, and I am constantly hiking. But I also have pronation and require orthotics and a good, sturdy boot to hike without spraining my ankle every other step.

I have two pairs of Merrell Women's Moab Mid Waterproof Hiking Boots, and I still wear both of them. The first pair, I ordered a year ago, and though I'm out in them every day, the tread still looks brand new.

They are very reliable, even out in the rain. My first pair only lost it's ""waterproof"" viability when I had to walk in two feet of water on a hike. And I'm sure they probably could be sprayed with waterproofing spray to get them back into shape; I just haven't done it yet. If you know you're going to be out in a constant torrential downpour, rain boots are more appropriate, but these should keep you dry unless you're walking in water.

I mentioned that I have pronation, and this can make me very prone to spraining my ankle. These boots have a good mid-height that keep my ankles secure, but they're not so stiff that they cause chafing. You'll find when you first get them that they're only a little stiff, and one or two walks will probably be enough to break them in.

Both my pairs are a half-size larger, and I did this based on other reviews. I highly recommend this as well, as I find that if I'm wearing bulky socks, they can rub a little on my outer toes even at a half-size larger.

They're very comfortable. Not exactly walking on clouds, but your feet are definitely are not going to hurt after five or six hours on the trails. I wear Doc Martens to work (office work, but I'll never wear heels), and when I slip the Merrells on, they do feel like slippers.

I have worn several other waterproof day-type boots (leading brands), and I lost treads and the boots fell apart quickly. These are definitely for the long haul and worth every penny."

The nonstick chicken broth was perfect, and I don't have to worry about the chicken being cooked too hot, since I don't need to worry about it being cooked too cold.  This grill is perfect for the heat I need to heat up the steak, as well as to cook the other meats.  I can also use it for the other meats, such as chicken, beef, pork, and chicken breast.

1,"I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

I recommend and do like the no zip.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't store the stroller folded and standing upright.  Perhaps I'll need to get a luggage strap to wrap around."

1,"Bought this to try for reducing wind noise while motorcycling.  The directions were clear, and the product was easy to use.  I wound up using a little less than half of the mixed compound for each ear, and it worked fine.  The thing is they do not reduce wind noise much at all.  Had much better results with the ""shell""-type plugs like eargasm.  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs, I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding.  Also tried them off the bike, and in comparison to standard plugs they do not block as much sound for other activities like mowing the lawn.  They are, however, much more comfortable than standard plugs as they do not exert as much pressure on your ear canal."

My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time.

1,"We did Christmas a week early with one side of the family, and this was literally the ONLY toy (besides paper and boxes) our VERY active 21-month-old played with at all, and he sat with it for at least half an hour in one sitting.  It took him several tries to figure out how to get the coins into the slots and get his fingers out of the way.  It would admittedly be easier if they were open slots to drop into instead of having to the circles that barely fit the coins, since clumsy toddler fingers make it a bit difficult, but he eventually figured it out.  He's a toddler, though, so he doesn't make it every time, and it sometimes frustrates him.

Some things you might not be able to see from the photos and description:
>The coin slot at the top drops the coins into the coin return on the left.  You can watch the coin slide down via a ""track"" in the back.
>The yellow display at the top is actually button that changes the ""display"" (it's just a roll with images on it) every time you press it.
>Once you stack up the coins in the register, you have to swipe a ""credit card"" through the slot on top of the drawer to make them all drop into the drawer.

It works great, but it is not as bright as the old one.  I have to use a larger diameter bulb, which is a lot better.  It has a very nice white base, but I like the white base on my new one.

The only issue I have is that it is not as bright as the old one.  I put it in a dimmer, and it is still dim, but it is only about 10 watts.  I would be much happier if it was a little brighter.  It would be better if it was a little brighter.

The only thing I would change is that I have to turn it on for 20 minutes, then turn it off for 5 minutes, then turn it off for 10 minutes, then turn it on again for 20 minutes.

1,"Putting one of my all-time favorite books, Robert Kurson's ""Shadow Divers,"" into documentary form could not have been better served than having the two men who actually lived it, John Chatterton & Richie Koehler, reenacting their roles!  John Chatterton is a total man with his perfect code of ethics, his raw courage & experience, his class 'A' intelligence and heroic handsome features.  Richie Koehler originally hung with a band of bad boys and had a major problem at home, as well.  However, Chatterton knew and valued his abilities, raw courage and superb  knowledge, so he went to work to get him on the right side of history with himself.  John & Richie have created one of the richest stories of modern times; and, by doing it have solved one of the last persistent mysteries of WWII.  (Add to this the amazingly nail-biting writing style of Robert Kurson from the original book, and you have a story for the ages.)  It further contains the sorrowful father & son tragedy which also happened for real.  This documentary presents the best of human exploration with the very compelling and heartfelt knot in throat conclusion.  I recommend this DVD to all who have read the book, and all who enjoy the heartbeat and heartstop of stories of buried treasure.  This is the ultimate, as it happens underwater with zero room for error!"

Hiaasen's style is humorous, current and filled with characters and their development that make the read chuckle and laugh out loud.  Hiaasen's style is succinct, stylistic, and  creative.

Have recommended Hiaasen to many friends over the years and have yet to have one say his books were not a great read."

1,"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide."

1,"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus."
1,"Poor, misguided, drunken Superhero Hancock, seems to have lost his way along with his memory. Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.  After all, what is waiting another few years to find complete happiness, for someone who waited 80 years to discover the truth about who he is?"
1,"This book is basically a continuous of book one. It pretty much picks up where book one ended. The only difference is there is more of Bran And Tyrone's point of view through out this book along with Lance and Tide.

In this book I was able to see that Lance and Tide where able to feel more comfortable in their relationship. I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and less based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice parts of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that passes Lance was more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feels like he has the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desires because Tide supports him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion.

Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's wants and needs but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional needs any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way.

Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make changes and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future books in this series.

I cannot wait till the next one comes out if their is a next one that is. I enjoyed getting to know these two couples and hope to read more about them in the future."

1,"As usual, Harry Bosch is a fascinating enigma; Michael Connelly is a master at the police procedural. It is New Years Day and a dog finds a bone in the Hollywood Hills. The dogs owner, a physician, knows the bone is human  a 10 to 12 year-old boy.

Thus begins an intriguing case that makes lots of hard turns. The murder occurred 20 to 25 years before and the victim was brutalized on a regular basis.

The case is fascinating, Harrys love interest and their relationship is not. Julia, a boot, is a mature woman who went through the police academy months earlier.

As sharp as Harry is, he begins a relationship with her rather quickly  even though it is against LAPDs policy for a supervisor and new recruit to be romantically involved. I just didn't feel that the relationship was real; the interactions seemed wooden.

One of the things that I like about Michael Connelly is that he isn't afraid to take chances with his main character, Harry. The case provides one surprise after another but the ending was a shocker.

1,"Ok so I just got these and they fit really well (In my opinion). Im a womens size 7 1/2 and I got in a mens 6. These are the Rewinds and the seller says that they are in men sizes only.

When I first got the skates I had a hard time turning corners but after loosening the axle a bit I still have trouble but its probably just because I need to practise.

The wheels are harder than I expected and not for rough surfaces like roads (though Im sure I read that they could be used outdoors) so I might need to buy softer wheels to do that.

For an affordable skate its good and from the looks of it, it most likely will last me a good while until I can afford the Moxi skates.

So basically size is good & fits good. The only issue right now is the limiting wheels."

I'm a huge fan of the M/M genre. I've read all of the 3 books in this series and I have no problem following up on the other stories. This was a very good read.

1,I was happy when I order the product and looking forward to using my lamp post.  The quality to use them as a lamp post was not the best.  So I thought no big deal I will use them on my deck.  Only 2 of the lights work.  I have changed the batteries in all of them. In the inside something will not make contact with the light.  I contacted the seller and there was no restitution to the problem.  So I use the casing and I put tea lights in them.
0,"I am the Princess of Love.  I love these jars.  These are the best!  They are super easy to use, easy to clean, and clean easily.  I have used them for everything from baking to using a coffee pot.  I use them to heat up the coffee, to make a quick pot of tea, or to make a quick cup of soup.  I just put them in the fridge for a few minutes, then put them in the fridge for a few minutes to get them warmed up.  You can also make a cup of coffee with them, and then put them in the refrigerator for a couple days to make sure they don't get too hot.  I have been using them to heat up my coffee for about a month now, and I love how they keep the coffee hot for a long time.  I also like how they are easy to clean.  I have tried the molds I've had before, and they are still working great.  They are good quality, but I'm a little concerned that they won't last much longer.  I think they will be a bit pricey, but I'm going to try them for sure!  I have"

1,"I have long been fascinated by the fauna and Flora of Australia. This charmingly illustrated tale of the life cycle of a lonely bandicoot was hard to put down. The author humanized this creature and his encounters with other fauna of the outback. It is clearly a harsh environment and these creatures are threatened by non-native species as well as the droughts, floods and fires of this amazing island. I came away with a greater understanding of the rare desert marsupials."

1,"I bought this game to use with children who have ADHD or other behavior problems. I got it on sale for about $10, so I really didn't expect much. (Why else would it be half-price, right?) But kids absolutely love it! Every child that used this game asked for it as soon as they came into my office. My own children love it, too. I used it with kids from roughly ages 3 - 9. They loved taking out the pizzas and getting them out of their pizza boxes. They also loved the silly toppings like a soccer ball or stinky sock. My 3-year-old likes playing the game, but he also likes pretending he is baking the pizzas in the oven (which is the game box). It lends itself well to adaptation and being creative with the instructions. It's durable, survived lots of kids. Kids are very competitive and did not really like that there is no winner, but I did like that aspect. It helped with working on teamwork skills. Great game, especially for the price!"

0,"This is a party game, and it's a very fun game.  There is a lot of strategy involved, but the stakes are high.  The players are not the same as other games that have a little strategy involved, so it's a fun game.  But you have to know what to do to get the hang of it, and you have to think about how you're going to do that.  It's a pretty simple game, but it's well made and fun to play.

The goal is to have a group of people who are going to be in a circle with the other players.  Each player has a different kind of magic that they use to bring down the other players.  Some of the magic works better than others, but I think it's a good way to mix things up.  I think the players are going to like it, and they're going to have fun playing this game.

1,"I downloaded a free copy of this book from Story Cartel in exchange for my honest review.

I was surprised by this book. I thought I was going to read about someone bemoaning how bad and horrible love is, but I was pleasantly surprised!

Kelsye Nelson delivers a witty list in ""Five Things You'll Hate About Me"". After reading I realised that it's something most of us do - we make a list of why things won't work out - when contemplating whether or not to give love and new relationships a try. Quick and speedy, but refreshing all the same.

Surprise and Disbelief is the second story. It's also fast-paced, but requires a little more depth of concentration. It's a sort of coming-of-age story - the heroine keeps going back and forth between her first love and different guys before she makes up her mind. It's my least favourite of the stories, probably because I would've liked a little more on the story, and because I kept wondering what was wrong with the heroine.

Girl on a Hot Tin Roof was my favourite: I totally got it! Sometimes, you want to... just be! The story is about a young girl who has become a little more than overwhelmed by the male attention she's receiving from the construction workers across her street.

All in all, not a bad read, but would've preferred the last two stories to have a little more length.

I would recommend this book for persons looking for a light, witty, quick read."

1,"I do like it. It works well. The complaints I have about it are relatively minor:
1) It does use quite a bit of space. To keep the arms from extending beyond the back of my desk (which was important in my particular setting), I had to mount it (drill the hole) almost 12"" in from the back edge of the desk. That places the monitors about 15"" in from the back edge of the desk.
2) Cord management is minimal. The upper of the arms, the cords are simply ""tied under"". The lower of the arms, the cords are held inside by the most complex piece of molded plastic known to man, which must be carefully inserted by a Plastics-Certified Brain Surgeon. I am surprised that they didn't think to allow the cord management to share a hole with the support itself, which would have been handy.
3) It says ""amazon basics"" on a prominent logo right in the middle of the base. I don't need more logos on my stuff, unless you're going to pay me handsomely to display them. (This will work to cover the logo: https://smile.amazon.com/Scotch-Duct-Black-1-88-Inch-60-Yard/dp/B0013AX6FC/)

1,"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.
This book must be read in a calm and sober way.  The author is not attacking the religious individual;  just questioning the true validity of all these man made concepts and gods."

Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez, and (even) The Rock have given fine performances. The special effects may be a bit too over-the-top but it's still marvelous to look at. Fast pace, fast adventures, and a different music score (this time it's Alan Silvestri and not Jerry Goldsmith) give feast for the eyes and ears. Watch this movie. It'll help you escape far far away."

1,"I like Amazon/Warrior Women stories a lot. There doesn't need to be much plot to them for me to devour them. Having said that, and the fact that it was awhile ago that I read this, I really enjoyed the story. I had read some reviews voicing concerns about events taking place in the book, but considering the time these events took place (alternate reality, as it were,) this didn't bother me. I'm just reviewing this now, because I still remember things in the story; it's thread still excites me. I have it in my ""to read again pile,"" which says a lot. I will also say that even though this is a Book One in a trilogy, this book stands on its own nicely. In fact, I really have no desire to finished this trilogy. I previewed the other two books and they don't hook me like this first book did. Unlike other trilogies I've read, there is no cliffhanger, that I recall. Overall, a rather enjoyable, (albeit long,) story. I don't normally read nearly 600 page stories. Aside: I don't care one whit about this author's gender issues. misrepresentations or not. We all have our gender discoveries to make, many take a lifetime to resolve. Far be it from me to judge from afar without walking in someone else's shoes. I buy books that I like for content. I don't care if it's a ghostwriter, a straight man writing as a lesbian, a f2m, m2f, transgender. Or any other gender I missed. Reviews should be about books, and author's style; they should not be direct attacks on said author's person. And full disclosure: I was born a woman; and, yes, I am a lesbian. I do not read most books mainly for the sexy bits. I absolutely believe you can be straight and write good gay/lesbian dialog. Love and emotions are universal."

1,"I have had 3 pairs of this headset. I lost one, bought one for my wife, and bought myself a replacement. As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge."

Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child.

There are pictures on both sides of the board and the board is sturdy. The animals that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some cons that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the holes are NOT smooth so when the lace goes through the hole, it gets frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter loves this and it keeps her occupied for 30-45 minutes at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever. She loves the pictures and the wooden (rather than cardboard) pictures are perfect so we can get a lot of use out of this. Hope this review helps!"

She loves Sofia the First and enjoys playing this while her parents and I enjoy that it's helping her to learn. Her brother does not play this one so much, but he's great about helping his sister when she gets stuck. The game comes in a small tin which is perfect for taking the game anywhere.

1,"I bought this as an addition to another board I have. The board is entirely made of some sort of plastic while also providing a fishnet pattern for traction against your feet. Very sturdy with some stiff flex (the board has a curve) that makes it very nice to ride. For those wondering why they should buy this, one word, WATER. I live in Florida where it rains often so using my normal bamboo board is pretty much not a good idea. If it rains I'll just take this bad boy and worry not about any puddles. Also it's a great gift, so buy with confidence."

I hope it continues to be a great series.
1,"I've only done one miniature with these so far (not posting a picture because my painting skills don't do these paints justice).

These are great. The paint goes on so smooth, and it dries so quickly. I was able to put on one color, and in the time it took me to clean my brush and get a bit of the next color it was pretty much dry, so I didn't have to worry about smudging when I picked it up.  The only drawback is the paint I put on my little pallet also dried very quickly, so I learned to be very careful not to put too much on the pallet so I used it up quickly, and not to leave it sit for too long.

The metallic gold and silver are great. They really shine nicely.  These are fantastic paints and so much better than the ones I was using."

1,"Mary Shelley, who, in my assumption, was truly a fascinating author. She weaved together a very fast moving extraordinary saga, THE LAST MAN that kept me enthralled. Lionels life began on a cheerful note, but then tragedy struck. As I watched Lionels emotions go from sorrow, to bliss, back to sorrow, then grief in one brief moment took him by the throat and would not let go until his heart was broken. As deep depression set in he felt pure torment and could do nothing but try to comfort those around him as his dear friends, neighbors, and family departed, one by one, from what seemed to be a never-ending epidemic that swept through each countryside. This skillfully written masterpiece of a seriously tragic and also an intensely passionate story regarding love found, then lost through devastation, which led to unspeakable sorrow and loneliness, held me as I read line after line, and page after page, savoring every word. As I followed Lionel through his existence, in each chapter he must take action against this foe that always seemed to have the upper hand in everything, and yet, each time, he knew he must move on because of the need to find others. Will he have to live in constant silence, or will there be someone out there waiting to be heard? From the Sibyls Cave, where it all seemed to initiate, all the way through to the end, or the start of a new beginning, this fascinating tale of intrigue led me down some desolate paths, and through some unforgettable and very picturesque forlorn valleys."

1,"The popular British World War II detective series ""Foyle's War"" returns for an encore performance with Set Six and three new episodes set in the months following VE Day.  Michael Kitchen returns as Detective Christopher Foyle, still Chief of the Hastings Police Station but awaiting his relief.  Honeysuckle Weeks is back as Foyle's former driver Samantha ""Sam"" Stewart, now demobilized with a new job and a new relationship.  Anthony Howell is Detective Milne, just promoted to head of the nearby Brighton Police Station and negotiating an unfamiliar relationship with his former boss.  The new episodes are excellent, with hard-hitting historical context.  Detective Foyle has lost none of his passion for justice, while the return of peace hasn't done away with crime.

In ""The Russia House"", the search for a missing Russian POW turns into a complicated murder mystery with national security implications.  Foyle must deal with the intelligence services, a White Russian refugee organization, and a shameful wartime secret.

In ""The Killing Time"", the presence of African-American GI's at Hastings triggers a spate of racial prejudice.  A crime attributed to one of the GI's turns into a complex mystery.

In ""The Hide"", a newly retired Foyle, awaiting a long-cherished trip to the States, gets involved in the strange case of a British traitor who refuses to defend himself at trail.  The details of the case connect to a murder and an unexpected skeleton in Foyle's own closet.

The ending of the stories nicely accounts for the series leads without foreclosing the possibility of future reunions.  ""Foyle's War: Set Six"" is very highly recommended to fans of the series."
1,"I've long loved the Sister Arnold series but this one was just too much to stomach. It's preachy, that looooong section on England's foxhunt had zip to do with the story and was a personal argument from the author.  Second, I found myself pitying the one character the reader was meant to hate--- this character was far more interesting than the good guys. As for the good guys they suddenly came off as smug and downright cruel to anyone who wasn't in the circle of Sister's friends. Speaking of Sister, I didn't like what's happened to her character, she's changed. I didn't like this version of her at all--maybe Brown just didn't put enough effort into this novel. The animals were wonderful but there wasn't enough of them. I found myself getting irritated as I read Hounds and the Fury and had to force myself to finish it. Will I buy the next book? Maybe, if I find it used somewhere and even then, only if it's super cheap."

On a whim, we decided maybe he would like these 2 dollar sticks that are NATURAL and good for chewing, teething, and oral hygiene. AND THE STICKS CAME IN TODAY. We gave him one to start out with so he doesn't get bored with a bunch of sticks at once. Well, he won't let it go except to play fetch. It's his new favorite thing ever. He loves it. He's going absolutely crazy. He only gets this way for feather toys and catnip sticks now apparently. GOOD BUY. Worth the money if you know how to keep cat toys interesting. Just play with your cat.

1,"I have never read Peter Mayle's ""A Year in Provence"" but I had heard of it, so I was interested in reading his newest ""The Corsican Caper"".  Apparently it is the latest in a series of short novels (this one is very short at 159 pages) whose main character and sleuth/trouble shooter is Sam Levitt.  Sam and his girlfriend Elena come to Marseille for the superb food, wine and scenery.  They stay with good friend billionaire Francis Reboul at his fabulous estate, Palais du Pharo, the biggest and most glamorous private residence in Marseille.  A dark cloud descends onto this gathering in the form of Russian billionaire Oleg Vronsky, who determines that this estate should be HIS, and is willing to go to any lengths to get it.

Basically, this is a quick little read, with a thin plot, lightweight characters and lovely descriptions of food and scenery.  For all of that, it is enjoyable.  Think of it like tapas...small amounts that you can savor briefly.  I would read more of these.

I received this book in exchange for my honest review from the Amazon Vine Program."

1,"A lovely, quick read about a shy, lonely artist who works as a night security guard in an art museum. He has worked there 20 years, sustained by his long-time friendship with former girlfriend, Melinda, and especially by his love for a woman who exists only in an obscure painting, hanging in a quiet corner of his museum. Christmas is Henry's favorite time of year, and so it is appropriate that he spend Christmas Eve with Rebecca, as he has named the woman in the painting, and that she will somehow be the one to give him the greatest gift.

1,"The first fountain lasted less than 1 month. The cheap plastic part just broke off in my hand when I was cleaning the system for only the 3rd time. The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!"

I wanted an easily rechargeable light that would fit inside my PSK Personal Survival Kit in a tin (a Whitman Sampler tin that had chocolates in it).

Holds a charge a long time and gives up to 40 hours (in the lower light mode) for an emergency condition, or strong light source for short time periods.

1,"My 2 year old daughter and 5 year old nieces absolutely love this toy! The playset comes with a pretty Cinderella figure, the carriage that has molds built into it, and 3 jars of Playdoh. We love that the carriage has molds you can press the Playdoh into to make the fairy god mother, her dress skirt, Jaq, Gus, birds, and a pumpkin. The Playdoh presses easily into them and comes out easily as well without ruining the mold you just made and it's easy to peel away the excess Playdoh around it. Her favorite is that the wheels of the carriage have brick imprints and Cinderella's slipper to make a stunning walkway for Cinderella to walk on. The top of the carriage is really neat that you can press it down and make pumpkin vines. The carriage itself is gorgeous and colorful and doubles as a working rolling carriage for Cinderella to ride in as well as for making the molds.

The plastic carriage is thickly made and very durable to handle even rough play from younger kids. My daughter also likes to reenact the story with the molded figures and so it can be used for dramatic play as well. She also uses her other Disney Princess figurines to interact with Cinderella, though we don't put Playdoh on them. I love the creativity and old school fun this toy offers without any ritzy technology like most toys these days.

The only downside to this toy is that it's hard to clean the Playdoh out of the vine press, but that's to be expected. It would've been nice to have a cutting tool included too. Overall, this is a big hit in our house and well worth the price, plus you can buy more Playdoh colors to go with this!"

The only reason I ordered a size 6.5 is because I thought they would be too tight. They were fine but it was too tight. I would have liked to have ordered a size 7.5 but I would have given them a 6.5 because I'm a big girl and these fit so well. They are cute though. I'm not sure if they will stretch as I wear them out of the house though. I would probably order the smaller size, but I'm not sure how long it will hold up.

If you have a wide butt, it is not as big as I thought it would be. I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and the shirt I ordered had a nice, long sleeves. I have a very small chest, so I would have ordered a medium. It was too big for me. I would have gotten a medium. I think I might order a half size up.

1,"I was curious as to how well these balls would hold up.  I have a large German shepherd who is an aggressive chewer.  After he destroyed the first ball after chewing on it for 15 minutes, he has learned to be more gentle of his chewing with them (Note: these balls are tougher then a regular tennis ball, with the added bonus of a squeaky noise when chewed on or squeezed.)  They do seem to be the same size as regular tennis balls.  My boys are very happy with these balls, and I am hoping they will hold up at least for a month.  I think next time I will buy the larger size balls though."
1,"What did I just read? Honestly, going in to this story I didn't realize it was going to be so short and have such a cliffhanger and I don't think the story ended at the appropriate moment. It's like having a movie cut out in the middle of the scene. This story actually felt that it was placed somewhere in the middle/beginning middle of a story. By the end of the book I didn't feel that I knew any of the characters and don't feel invested in the story at all. The premise is interesting, but there's not enough in this book to make me read the next books.

Also, this is not the complete series. You get book one with this download and then if you write a review and send the author a screenshot of it you get the rest of the series. I'm especially not pleased by that sort of underhandedness."

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.  While other reviewers claim this gun is powerful, mine isn't, at least compared to my Crosman.  I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this."

I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.

I have slender legs and have trouble finding boots that fit my calves without making me look like I'm standing in two buckets.  These are fine tucked into skinny jeans.  The heel is a reasonable height, and they are pretty boots.  Contrary to what one reviewer said, I believe the suede portion is real but the buckel trim is man-made.

1,"This medical kit is just okay. Naturally, my daughters favorite part is the stethoscope. Unfortunately Fisher Price decided to make the war pieces so large that they won't even kind of fit into an adult ear, much less a 3 year olds. Also, the stethoscope is very rigid and tough to play with. The bag that comes with it is somewhat of a joke. It's very difficult to fit everything inside (especially that rigid stethoscope), and it really doesn't stay closed so everything just falls out. She does enjoy the shot thing and the thermometer though. Overall I'd go with a different toy medical kit if I could."

Worth reading Fluency first as it sets some of the stage for a little background info.  Not that important though."
1,"I love Key and Peele but have to admit that this movie was very silly. I laughed aloud in several places but not nearly enough. The comedians that starred in this film have so much talent that seemed a bit wasted because this movie was about 15-20 mins longer than it should have been. This would have been terrific as a 1 hour Key & Peele comedy special, but it doesn't quite work as a feature film.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the kitten that played Keanu was absolutely adorable!! That cat was the true star of this movie. And it's precious that Keanu Reeves was the voice of the cat in one scene of the movie.

If you can see Keanu for $3.99 or less, then watch it. If it costs more than that, I would pass."

1,"FRANK ALTOBELLI'S ""TRUE HEART"" (REVIEW)

This book was wonderful! It had the perfect amount of fantasy and adventure along with a love story that was sweet and unexpected. Mouse, the heroine of the novel is almost sprite-like in her mannerisms and you can tell she has a heart of gold. When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

1,"Got this the other day as a ""daily special"" for an extra $23 off.  VERY easy to install (especially after watching the short install video provided here on Amazon).  If I can install it successfully, ANYONE can.  I had more trouble getting my crusty 15-year old lock off than I did installing this one.

There is one thing that should be pointed out - when you test the ""keyless"" lock operation, it gives you a few seconds to change your mind before actually engaging the lock - so when you install this and then test out that feature, it can seem as though the lock is not locking if you IMMEDIATELY turn it back to ""test"" it - you have to lock, then wait a couple of seconds."

1,"My standards for movies are relatively simple - the plot has to engage me to the end without offending my intellect or my spiritual understanding of the world, the storyline should have redemptive value, and the action and script should be believable and appropriate to the situation portrayed. This movie sits on my shelf because it fits all these categories.
It's the story of a kidnapping, but it revolves around the person left behind - and here lies it's strength. Even though I am no great fan of Meg Ryan, her intensity and anguish were believable and moving. Russell Crowe is (as usual) excellent at defining a character in thin lines of nuance while David Norse was achingly fragile and volatile.
Its rare to find a film that doesn't deserve it's R rating. I think this is one of them. The language and violence in this film are wholly appropriate to the subject matter, and thankfully, all other offensive content was cut during the editing process.
A taut, emotional action film with a gratifying end."
1,We bought this to get the hard top off our jeep and to store it when not in use. It has worked great.
1,"From the female of the family: This beautiful top is a lot more than a ""T-shirt."" It is simple, yet elegant. It's reversible -- no, you don't wear it inside out -- but can wear front or back as the front! This means, the neck is either ""boat"" or a shallow V.

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

I've only come across the Royal Robbins brand recently and I think the quality and style of their lines are excellent.

1,"I had high expectation of these boots considering they were #12 best selling men's shoes. I mainly wanted insulated boots that looked good.

These were NOT waterproof. I tested them by filling the bath tub with 2-3 inches of water and standing in these boots - within 20-30 seconds both the boots let the water in. I am not sure if I got defective boots OR they are supposed to be only waterproof in light rain / light snow kind of situations.
I did the same test with my Timberland Gore-Tex hiking boots and they didn't let any water in - no matter how long I waited.

Also these boots are quite ugly - they are too wide for some reason.

1,"I have 2 daughters and found this book while searching for a new story about sisters.  The reviews were so good, and the pictures I could see so sweet that I ordered it.  When it arrived I read it to myself and indeed my eyes did smart towards the end.  But instead of thinking about my daughters I found myself thinking of myself and my 2 older sisters.  I related perfectly to the conflicting feelings of the little sister, and to the conclusion in which love for her big sister won out, but she still kept her afternoon alone to herself, something that's hers alone.  I adore the illustrations and feel the story is perfectly told for about 3-7 year olds - just enough repetition for new readers, too.  I'm impressed with the way it addresses the topic of conflict between sisters, without making anyone the bad guy, or without being obnoxious or shallow.  My daughters are still a little too young for this book but I expect it will become a classic in our family.  My highest compliments to this author."

0,"It seems to me that this movie is an attempt to take a lot of the elements from the original (as well as the original theatrical version) and put them into a new light. The story is well told and the acting is outstanding. There are some very funny moments. The movie also has a very good twist at the end, which is a very good twist at the end.

Overall, I liked it.  I'm not sure I'd watch it again, but if you like comedy, it's not hard to find.  Just don't let the movie get too old or too old for you.  A must see for any comedy lover.I love the actors in this movie.  They are all great.  This movie is one of those movies that will leave you with a feeling of the writers, directors, actors and the actors.

1,"These are very comfy shoes! I usually wear a 10 and bought a 10 in these and they fit perfectly.  I have medium wide feet and they are roomy and comfortable. The goga mat insole is what makes this shoe I think. It has a really nice rubbery bounce feel under my feet. I have been having problems with my feet hurting from not enough cushion in my old running shoes and these have been a really nice change with my feet not hurting after my walks ( I walk about 5-6 miles a day on gravel trails, and the gravel usually pokes up into the bottom of my shoes and bruises my feet but these protected me pretty good).  I didn't like the looks of this shoe online but purchased it because I was looking for skechers and other brands that have very cushioned rides. These looked better in person than I thought and the mesh look is different looking in person (it seems like it's more of a fabric texture and less of a large mesh material than it looks like in the picture, although they seem breathable enough, they don't have large mesh holes like I originally pictured). I'm still not in love with the way these look, but they are good for taking out on the trails, and it's kind of nice to have a new pair of shoes I don't mind getting dirty (instead of the pretty kind of new shoes that I really only want to save for the gym and places they won't get messed up :)
Overall, definitely happy with these runners."

1,"As MATA HARI, Garbo shows us hints of what was soon 2 come(Queen Christina, Camille) but in THIS film she is a sexy siren. No wonder 20s and early 30s people fell head over heals for her. All other ""goddesses"" are pale shadows. There was nothing as magical as Garbo. The script is corny at times, Lionel B. hams  his part(see Mickey Rooney ""do him"" in BABES IN ARMS 1939) but the film has a magic air that is spellbounding... In no way a great thriller or a suspenser(laughable when it is attempting 2)but a great GARBO vehicle. Roman Novarro is OK but is ruined with some of the lines he has to say."

THe main character while chastising his son was also guilty of judging based on skin color and religious preference and materialism.

Maybe more depth would have been possible if not as much time was spent on the grieving that takes place after you lose your spouse.

1,"Assembling the unit takes about 5 minutes.  You will need one 7/16"" wrench (or ratchet or crescent wrench or 11 mm wrench) to tighten the nylock nuts that hold everything together.  As the bolts are all carriage bolts, no screwdriver or other wrenches are required.  Once assembled, the unit attaches to the ladder with a pair of locking pins.  At first glance the assembled products doesn't seem like it would fit as securely as I'd like.  However, I attached it to a 32' Louisville type IA ladder and it actually fits very securely.  Upon lifting the ladder to a height of about 22' and leaning it against the shingles on my roof, I found the product to be very secure and the ladder very stable.  My gutter-cleaning problems are now over.

I did get a bit of a bit of a kick out of it, but I didn't feel like I was getting any real closure. It was a bit of a surprise to me, but I did enjoy it. -The characters. I liked them.

1,"This book is typical of the genre and is filled with angst, smoking hot scenes and complete and utter denial and misunderstandings. It covers all of the bases that fans have come to expect. Two people who are complete opposites find themselves attracted to each other but have a million reasons why they can't be together.

This is the first book in the Lost Boys series and it is safe to say that Devlin is a little lost and a whole lot bad. Sometimes I find myself really getting behind this kind of character but there was something about Devlin that was holding me back. I didn't love him as much as I would have liked and I found that a little disappointing. It is hard to pinpoint what exactly was off but it was definitely something. Perhaps it was some of his questionable moves. I'm not sure. He just didn't seem as sincere in regards to Rena as I would have liked. Rena was also a little on the weak side for my liking as well. Their relationship lacked the depth that I was craving.

Although I did find the characters a tiny bit weak it was still an entertaining and easy book to read. I think there is promise for future instalments of this series."

1,"This is a great clipper for the price. I got this clipper from Walmart for $45.00. Amazon had it for 64.00. Usually Amazon is cheaper. However I like the clipper. It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle. I have been doing it for a little over 2 years so I have got pretty good at it and pulling hair out of ears, squeezing anal glands, cutting under the pads,and cleaning teeth. There is just so much more to clipping a dog.... I would buy it again"
1,"After reading many pet water fountain reviews, I bought this fountain as a solution to my cats constantly drinking out of the toilet.  I have water that I change in 2 large ceramic dog bowls twice a day in different locations, one by their kibble dish and one upstairs.  They still use all the options but drink out of the fountain enough so that I have to add between a pint and a quart of water each day.

I have 2 long-haired cats and 2 short-haired, all under a year old.  The fountain has not clogged from all the hair!  It's great that it has a filter.  I clean it  every week or 2 by hand.  It's simple to clean, no need to use a dishwasher.  I place the top part on the floor and take the bottom part to the kitchen to wash, and vice versa.  The cats have to check out the empty fountain and watch while I refill it.

It was easy to set up.  Once I figured out that the hose from the pump needs to go into the opening in the top part of the fountain, there was nice water movement.

I didn't find a specific mat to go under it, but I have it in a place where there is tile so it doesn't matter if water splashes out.  If anyone knows what mat works best with this, please add that to your review.

I have it in the living room and I think location is important.  There's a lot of activity in that room and they prefer being where the action is.  And now part of the action is drinking water from the fountain.  It's on the floor near a scratching post and near the cat door.

It's a very quiet fountain.  You can hear the pump slightly, but it's a relaxing sound.  I don't unplug it at night.  It runs 24/7."

1,"Another dark Burke novel exploring the under belly of society.  Burke, cautious as ever, has to find out why a potential client is killed over something in Burke's past.  Again, Burke gets drawn down dark paths that people do not want to talk or think about: child-porn and the baby market.  Where the villians mask themselves as upstanding citizens and criminals make justice.  Intriguing characters.  Gets you thinking hard about right, wrong and downright evil. --Doug Setter, author of One Less Victim"
1,"I purchased this for around $130 as a back up. I figure, I am spending this much money, it oughtta be a pretty decent unit. Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

3.29.2012 Update

Now that I have had it for some time, I would still have purchased another unit. HOWEVER, hooked up to my laptop, it operates much better than on my PC. Not quite sure why this is, but doesn't really matter. At this point I would not call it horrible, just unsatisfactory."
0,"This kitchen is adorable! Here's what I love:

- The kitchen is a little large, but is so small that it's not too small for the little kids to take in. - The kitchen is in a large storage case. - The kitchen has a lot of storage space. - The kitchen has a matching plastic table with several pieces of furniture. Overall, I think this kitchen is pretty good. It's easy to clean, and the kids love to play with it. The little kids will really enjoy playing with it, and it's a great addition to their kitchen. I'll be keeping this review as a Christmas present for my kids. I have been playing with this at work for over a year now and I've had no problems. I have a little girl who loves it and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. It's not quite as big as I thought it would be, but it's still pretty darn cute. I don't think it's going to hurt my kids, but it's a good size for a little kid. It's well made and it's very well made. I received this item as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. Very cute. My granddaughter loves it."

1,A friend sent me this book thinking I needed the info!  It was really well written and answered all my questions.  I discovered eating and a sedentary lifestyle aren't the only things that can cause weight gain.  There was info on supplements that I wan't familiar with.  It took all the mystery out of heart monitors. I now have a better idea of how many calories I should be consuming.  And I found the section on muscle confusion really interesting.  This book is good motivation for weight loss!

I will keep feeding them this and they will be fine. My dog loves this bed! I will keep buying it. I have a dog who is obsessed with this food. This has given him a great amount of energy. It's very healthy for him and his digestive system."

I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.  I would recommend it for anyone with an average size.I bought this to replace the one I had when I lost my phone and it was a little uncomfortable. I didn't want to spend the money on another one. However, it was perfect for me. I used it to replace my original phone, but I felt the phone was too small. I was worried that it would break in. So I used it again"
1,"I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years. I to can not afford a brand new MacBook Pro, but getting one used is less expensive and they work and hold value. Highly recommend this MacBook Pro."

She's been playing with it all day and it's a bit messy.  I don't know how long it'll last.  I just hope it will last longer.  If it lasts as long as it does, I will purchase it again.We love these. They are a good size for toddlers and for adults. My son loves the little dots, and the kids love it. They are a big hit with our little ones.I bought this for my 4 year old son who loves Lego and loves building things. He's got a lot of them and he's only learning to build things with them. My 3 year old son loves it. I think it's great for him to build things and figure out how to get the pieces together. I love the colors.My daughter loves this puzzle.

1,"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet."
