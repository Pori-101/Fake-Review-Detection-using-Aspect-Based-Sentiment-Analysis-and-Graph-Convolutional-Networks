1,"This GPS served me fairly well (although my first update seemed to mess up its routing) for three years.  It routed in basic fashion, and did not surprise me too much.  The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes. A bit quirkier than the Magellan, POIs are not as good, but it is quite smart in its routing. I expect electronics to last a lot more than three years. No wonder there are so many refurbished 1412s out there! One star ONLY for lack of durability, but that is BIG."

0,So I've been reading this book for the last two years and it's always a pleasure to read. I had a friend who was a social worker and she had a lot of fun reading this book. It was a very interesting story about the lives of people living in the south. It was a great read. I read it several times over the course of a month and it made me want to get back to it. I'm looking forward to getting back to it. I have read all of her books and the series has been really good. I was actually not sure if this was a good book but it definitely was. I read this book first to get the idea of the book and now to get to the actual content. I can tell you I was a little worried that this book would be the last book in the series but I was glad I didn't. It was really well written and really kept you guessing as to who was who. I really enjoyed the interaction between the main characters and their personalities. I loved the idea that they were so different that it was possible for them to be very different and that I would like them to be together. I was really hoping that the story would have been longer and I think that is the case and I am glad that I did. I was also hoping that there would be more depth to the book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm happy I read it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed this book. It is a very good read and I have read the entire series.

0,"For this price, it's a nice size and the materials are good.  My only complaint is the extra large clamps.  I wish they were made of plastic, but it's not that big of a deal.  The clamps are also very thin and don't stay on for long enough to hold the dog's attention.  I'd be more inclined to buy the larger size.  My dogs love them and they're pretty strong.  I'd definitely buy again.  Overall, a very nice quality product.My dog absolutely loves this toy.  She loves to chase it and it makes her scratch.  She doesn't have a problem with scratching herself.  It is very soft and she's got a huge mouth.  She's only 9 months"

My daughter is still very young and still plays with it as a toy.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to learn.Great product for the price!These are great for teaching math.  We are very happy with them!I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this.  He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood.  It does a good job of holding up to the wind and I think it will be a great addition to our home

0,"Overall, I really liked this movie. The story line is good, and the acting is top notch.I really enjoyed the movie. The characters are interesting, and the plots are very interesting.The family is in the movie. I am very pleased.I really enjoy this show. The first season was a great one. I did not know about the ending, but I was really impressed. I just watched the second season and I am so glad I did. It's very sad that they chose to make this one. The series has been going on since the early 90s, and the series has always been a hit with fans.

I think they could have made a lot more of the same plot and characters, but I don't think they could have made it as good as the first season. I would have loved to have seen the final season, but I think the ending was a little too much. The show is very well done, and the end of the first season was a very good one. I would recommend this series to anyone who loves good family entertainment.The movie is a little slow, but it is a good movie.  The movie is very interesting and"

1,Super bright. Holds up well in the marsh so far
1,"The cover of the movie is a great portrayal of how the movie is going to go.
I thoroughly enjoyed this Poe-twist story line.  It gave some detail in the beginning of the movie (his anguish, tormented life), to keep you hooked to the end. As in his (Poe's) books; the fast-beating heart, time ticking away fervently, and turmoil to keep you always on the edge of your seat, was done well.  At times (Poe) could come off as being too brash.  But inevitably, you wound up feeling sorry for him. Each piece of the plot gently wound it's way to a complete story that would of course only end the Edgar Allen Poe way."
1,"Wow so glad this popped up to rate! I forgot what I had that I liked, for the past year have had a struggle finding one as solid (not wobbly, not easy to break, truly one handed) ... And now I can finally return the latest piece of crap I got and get this again!!"
1,"Alpha werewolf Yeager stumbles upon his mate during a biker get together in a small town.  Theres just one problem: his mates just a child.  So he resigns himself to waiting for her to grow up.  Years later, he returns to claim her, only to find that his arch-enemy has also discovered his mate and wants to destroy any chance Yeager has for everlasting love.

The idea of a werewolf finding his mate when shes too young is a new one for me, and I enjoyed the twist.  It also added a dimension to Yeagernot just that hes a good man, willing to wait, but also that when he shows up years later, hes been yearning and lonely for her all that time.

The addition of the rival wolf and the extremes he goes to to keep Yeager and Cassie apart gave the book a lot of tension.  AndI won't reveal any spoilersbut the ending is a whole nother twist that I didn't expect.

I liked the characters, the unique ideas and twists in this story and thoroughly enjoyed reading it."
0,"I'm a collector of figures, and I thought this would be a nice addition to my collection. It's not. I wish it came with the Tamiya version of the statue that I already had. It's a nice addition to my collection. I would definitely recommend this figure to others. Also, I'm not sure if it would have been a great addition to my collection, but I'm sure it would have made a great addition to my collection. I'd say it's a good buy."

1,I was so looking forward to this book.  I love the series and couldn't wait for this book to come.  I'm not going to spoil it for those who decide to pay this outrageous price for this book.  This book was seriously lacking from her other novels.  If not just down right boring.

1,"Cass is a single mother as a result of a one night stand.

Logan was the one night stand.

Now a twist if fate has them meet up again in somewhat secret circumstances.
Cass is Logans boss but she has no clue about his secret that could change everything.

This book started off at a steady pace, then it slowed down in the middle and hit it's stride again in the last 3rd.

Cass and Logan are both head strong and career driven. They have different experiences in life and this shows in each interaction they have. Because of the complexity of their situation there are a lot of undercurrents in their conversations, but only one of them is aware of it.

The author has done a good job showing the different sides to her characters personalities. The chemistry between Logan and Cass never diminishes and the love they have for their daughter despite the intricacies they face shines through and comes above everything else.

I enjoyed this story. The characters and the storyline is consistent and interesting and I liked the dynamics of the other relationships each Cass and Logan have with others such as Logan's grandmother and Cass's friend Patricia. Those relationships added another layer and also a bit of lightness to the storyline.

This is a great holiday read and worth one clicking if you like a good romance!

""The Love Deception"" is the third book in the series.  The first book was a bit different than the first two, but that's part of the reason I gave it 3 stars.  This book is still one of my favorite series.  I liked the characters and the storyline.  I liked the story line and the setting.  It had a good feel for the story.  I like that the main characters have strong personalities.  I liked how the story progressed.  I'm not sure why I gave it 3 stars.  I liked the pace.  The characters are well developed.  It's a fun read.I have read this author before and she is not disappointed. It is an awesome read and I was able to read it in one sitting. I was so happy to see that this book was on my to read list. I am so glad I read this book. I can't wait to see how it ends.

As most of you know, a lot of USB devices don't come with a USB cable. The same thing applied when I purchased my new printer.  The clerk who sold me the printer suggested I purchase a USB cable along with my printer ... the asking price: $29.95 for a 8 foot long cable.  I told him ""NO"".  Then purchased this cable on Amazon for $10.95 which included shipping.  The only thing that got to me about this deal was that the shipping cost more than I paid for the USB cable.  Oh well!  I bought some sushi with the 19 bucks that I saved!"

My only complaint is that the tiny seal that the air can tube fits against wears out too quickly and I have not figured out how to replace it (or get a replacement part).

The male plug side is too short - and will not properly seat in the XOOM to charge it properly.  When I tried to push it up, it shorted out against the housing.

I bought a NEW MOTOROLA charger, and have used it twice now, no issues with the plug and no shorting out.  So I recommend you save yourself my pain, and buy the Motorola OEM Charger (also on Amazon) for $9 vs. the $6.75 that this thing cost."

The Define 2 is a perfect replacement for my Logitech Harmony. I would definitely buy it again.Works great. I did not want the cable to fall out of the charger. I didn't want the cable to be bent over and on my charger. It's very easy to insert and close the charger. You can use the cable as a micro USB cable, or just plug it into a wall outlet. I like that it has a small detachable charger that you can leave in the charger for emergencies. I would recommend this product for those of you who are not concerned about your cable.I have a little cable bag that is used with my Kindle Fire.  It is not waterproof, but works well.  It is very durable.  I use it with my Canon 5D and it holds the Kindle Fire.  I do wish it had a wireless adapter to make it portable.  I was very disappointed in the fact that the size of the bag was only two inches.  I also have the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.  I had a little problem with the tablet not being able to move in the bag.

I placed it on the floor and she chewed on it. I ended up going to the vet and got the dog food and she has not been able to chew on it. She seems to like it too. She will play fetch with it and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a puppy. Pros:
-Good for small dogs
-Great for puppies
-Light weight
-Doesn't seem to irritate your dog at all

Cons:
-No texture at all
-You have to put the bag on top of the bed to get the bag to come off. I have not tried this product in my dogs home. My cats love these. My dog is about 20 lbs.

This is Susanne O`learys latest book which I've had the greatest of pleasure in reading as an ARC.
Isn't the cover great!
I love this author as she's taken a different chance on this story, more intense and romantically raw in my opinion with things to hide that come out later as you read further on into the pages.

I liked this one as much as I loved her previous book Hot Property. This isn't a carry on from that, its a stand alone book in its own right.
Its taken me today to sit down and read this lovely enjoyable read.

The only way to get this size is to use the iPad with an adapter. I haven't used it with a portable player, but I'll try it with a portable charger. Update: This review has been updated with an additional review. This product is great, it works great, it works, it has a really nice feel and it fits great. Pros:

It is like putting a fitted sheet on a pool table.  Our past ones have not had that option.  It was not stated in the description.  The reason that this is a problem for me personally is that it is really a two person job to put it on.  If you have two people to do the task, then this is a great cover for the price.  If you have to do it on your own prepare to struggle a bit."

1,I've been waiting (mostly patiently) for the third book in the Weston Family series.  I loved the first one so much and was sad to hear the publisher dropped the series.  Henry's book was worth the wait.  I loved that the conflict facing the couple was not external to them but internal fears that the Diana most conquer before getting her happily ever after.  After reading so many books that have gentlemen spies or villains it was nice to read a book that focused on the characters and their relationship.  I loved this book and hope that more Weston books will be coming.

1,"Once my daughter saw this at her 3rd birthday, she was not interested in anything else. This helps teach fine motor skills and my daughter caught on right away. She's doesn't quite understand to go from hole to hole in order - she wants to skip all over the board. Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child.

There are pictures on both sides of the board and the board is sturdy. The animals that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some cons that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the holes are NOT smooth so when the lace goes through the hole, it gets frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter loves this and it keeps her occupied for 30-45 minutes at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever. She loves the pictures and the wooden (rather than cardboard) pictures are perfect so we can get a lot of use out of this. Hope this review helps!"
1,"Well.....what a story! It is so hard to review without saying too much, so I will try.

I went into it kind of blind, wondering what it was about as i loved the cover and title and just wanted to read it.

Having been through so much so young, Lacey let it all go one night and did something she had never done before...slept with a man, drop dead gorgeous, instant attraction off the charts met in the club Caine. I mean sh^t it was melting how they were almost at it on the dance floor.

What a charming wonderful guy Caine was...romantic, caring, singing to her in front of everyone, melted my heart...a perfect gentlemen, opening car doors, a little possessive, but that is because he loves her right?

....he has an alcoholic mom and a troubled past and when events in life take a surprising twist....she agrees to marry him, even after a hiccup in their relationship...after visiting the courthouse, he stops opening the car door! Where did the gentleman go? My Heart Sank.

That was it..after reading along happily i was suddenly stopped dead......wow! You think you have been got with
what is coming next....no, you haven't!!

I loved the relationship between Lacey and Becca, i was laughing out loud during their conversations and in the hospital during the quiz i was freaking screaming! (You will know when you read it)

From 'The Pussy Doctor'....to 'Aunt Flo visiting', to the Smurf scene, i could barely breathe and this was such light relief after i had been through the drainer living through Lacey's life.

I hate to think what Lacey would have done without her friends and family.

I wanted Becca's con's list carved into his back with a rusty knife.......i think Becca would have done it.

The ending was something else, one thing.....then another, all wrapped up teetering over the edge of a sharp dark cliff edge!

Bring on the next enstallment!"

1,"When Grace Sings by Kim Vogel Sawyer is the second book in the Zimmerman Restoration Trilogy.  The family secrets keep coming.  In this novel, Alexa Zimmerman has opened a bed and breakfast in her grandmothers old home.  One of her long-term boarders is a journalist who has ulterior motives for being in Arborville.  Also coming to the community is Anna-Grace, a cousin of Alexas, who is planning on marrying Steven.  Secrets, both from the past and in the present, abound among the novels characters.  It seems that everyone has something to hide.  I enjoyed the book, but it was not one of my favorites.

I was sent a free print copy of the book by NightOwlReviews.com in return for my honest opinion of the book.  You can find this review on my blog at http://wp.me/p2pjIt-f6, and on Good Reads at https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1255165754."
1,"Normally I feed my cats Fromm Four Star dry foods but I was looking for something a little more budget friendly available with Prime shipping that was still a better brand. With four cats it gets expensive! After doing some research I found Earthborn which fit the bill. Normally 3 out of 4 of my cats are not picky so I wasn't worried about them liking it. However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off. Since they hate it, the only compliment I can give it is the bag I received had a slider to close the packaging to keep the kibble fresh. I wish more brands did this."

One thing I do need to mention about wearing a Buff, I found if I wash and condition my hair with products that make my hair very soft and smooth, the buff won't stay on for very long, especially if I am working outside It slides off and I keep having to readjust it. i I am just using a ""plain"" shampoo and minimal conditioner on the ends that seems to solve the problem., What i love is the buff idoes a great job keeping hair out of the way with out making me sweat more! Worth it If you like to work outside."

The film was shot in 24 hours, and the camera angles were spectacular. The film was shot in the park, and the locations were filmed in the mountainous terrain. The main subject matter was not the film itself, but the impact of a well-known story on the lives of the men who made it.

The film is presented as a beautiful film, and it shows that the people who made it were courageous and brave. The film shows the people who made it as well as the people who gave it their all to make it a reality. It is a great film to watch, and it is a story that is about a man and his art.

1,"I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around."

1,"Not bad for the price.
The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad."
1,"Most readers of John Le Carre know him for his more publicized stories; not as many have read back to the beginning.  I started as many readers with the more modern day stories and then I went back and read the famous, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.  Comparing the earlier Le Carre to the later day author is night and day.  So I decided to start at the beginning - Call for the Dead.

George Smiley is introduced to us in this book.  He is not the supreme spymaster at this point that he becomes later.  Some may argue this point, as his storied heroics from WWII are on display.  But he is not so confident of his skills or his governmental position.  His personal strife with the divorce of his wife Ann is described and this adds to his personality.  Smiley is not the king of the Secret World at this point and his inexperience is fun to see.

The story is very short on pages, but not on important developments.  At this stage of Le Carre's career, he could say much with few words.  The characters are surprisingly well developed in 128 pages.  The intricacies of the storyline are well thought out and the ending, if not totally surprising, is explained in detail - something that doesn't happen so often in Le Carre's later writings.

I found myself wired in to this story for no other reason that I felt I was watching the manifestations of some of the most famous spy characters in history - Mundt and Smiley.  I can't say that the story is so twisted that the reader can't figure it out, but I will say that the writing is so well done, that you can't help but read every word.  The reader can begin to see the mind of Le Carre as he takes a simple plotline and attempts to weave it a myriad of ways.

If you've liked the later books, treat yourself to this one - the creation."

1,"I was super-excited about the original films being released on Blu-ray......until the news arrived that Lucas was further altering them by adding new dialogue.

While the whole ""NOOOO!"" sequence has been much-ballyhooed by viewers, it did somewhat fit in 'Sith.'  For 'Jedi'.....absolutely not.  The original scene, where Vader quietly watches Palpatine attempt to murder Luke and then has a change of heart, is so much more powerful in that Vader makes his decision in complete SILENCE.  Considering that Anakin is depicted as a hotshot motormouth in the prequels, it makes the silence of the original cut of 'Jedi' so much more powerful.  (And, while I'm at it on 'Jedi', why did Lucas have to change the music at the end?  Totally ruined my childhood memories of watching my battered old VHS.)

Look, Mr. Lucas, as a writer/editor both in career and hobby, I can understand about creating something wonderful and then always wondering how it could have been made better.  Seriously, though.  Please stop.  You created an amazing fictional world that became bigger than anyone could have ever dreamed of.  It is a cultural phenomenon that has forever changed film and the lives of fans.  Why ruin a good thing?

1,"In her directorial debut, 27-year-old writer/director Gia Coppola recalls her niece, Sofia, more than her grandfather, Francis Ford.  The film, Palo Alto, based on short stories by co-star James Franco, is an anxious daydream of a film chronicling the coming of age of a few troubled teenagers in the titular Northern California city.  Among them is the smart, yet shy April (Emma Roberts), who engages in inappropriate flirtation with her older soccer coach, played by Franco.  The film is not defined by a sense of propulsion, but rather its sincerity, its concern for its characters' ethical conundrums, and a general air of authentic melancholy.  Everyone delivers a capable performance without overshadowing the other members of the ensemble; after years in the spotlight, this is far and away Roberts' most engaging and relaxed turn.  There are a few questionable storytelling and stylistic decisionsa disturbing house-party gang rape is related as an afterthought via almost wistful voice-overand the film is never as beautiful, moving, or sensual as the masterful The Virgin Suicides (a hard comparison to avoid), but the latest-to-the-game Coppola otherwise acquits herself nicely, confidently drawing the audience into the private lives and longings of the adolescent characters."

0,"I have always been a fan of the wide angle lens but after reading some of the reviews, I decided to give this a try.  The video quality is great and it is pretty much worth the price.  I have been using this for about a year now and it has been working great.  I have also tried it with a Sony camera and it is a great deal.  I just wish there was a way to access the video and the menu.

Overall, I am very happy with this camera and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a small lens that is easy to use and provides good image quality.  I would not hesitate to buy this camera again.I bought this and was a huge fan of the ""gigabit"" ethernet cable.  It has all the basic functions of a wired internet router and is a great value.  I love the fact that the cable is flexible and will fit anywhere"

1,"I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip."
1,"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing."

1,"In this book, David Birkenhead is still technically a rabbit, but he's now a free rabbit, no longer considered a slave by law.  But as he recovers from his injuries and considers his future, it's clear that most people still consider him to be a slave in all but paper.

As much as the anthropomorphized animal aspects might be weird -- my wife, for example, was a little squicked by it -- it actually served as an interesting proxy for our own history of racial slavery in the U.S.  In many cases I could see people treating the rabbits in much the way old slaveholders of the U.S. south would have treated them, and I also see what that slavery has done to the rabbits psyche, in terms of their expectations, their choices, and their self-image.  More than any furry aspect, it was this comfortable view of slavery that got under my skin more than anything else.

So, this book takes David from his injuries through to his official decoration for his heroic actions in the first book, and then onto the navy's officer academy with the Kings full blessing.  Of course, not everyone wants to see David succeed as the first free rabbit to enter the academy, and there's quite a bit of good struggle over that.  Along the way, he befriends a few other students in the academy, and for the climax, they go to an interstellar wargames competition between two opposing academies.  He acquits himself fairly well in a move that would have made even Ender Wiggin proud.

So, I'm pretty jazzed about it, even with the bunny ears and slavery, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series."

0,"This watch is my second pair of the same watch. I will keep this one in my collection.I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area.  He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which was perfect for him.  He wears a size 7 and a size 8.  I ordered a size 11 and the fit is perfect.  He will be wearing this watch all winter long.  The only negative I have is that it is very cheap material.  I am hoping the price will be higher, since he is a size 7.  Otherwise, it's a great watch.  The only negative is that it is very heavy and you cannot wear it with jeans.  However, it is not thin and thin enough to cover his entire body.  It is light, but very cool.  I have a size 8 and ordered a size 10.  I am hoping the price will go up a bit, since the band is a bit small and the band is a bit short.

0,"Spoilers: Not since Alien 3 has a movie with a third act gone wrong that a movie with a third act gone wrong had a movie with a third act gone wrong.  The result is that it's a little disappointing.  Some of the movie's dialogue and plot holes are almost laughable.  The only redeeming feature is the soundtrack.  There's a lot of music, but it's just not there.  I can't tell you how many times I've been so confused that I thought I'd never heard the music.  I know that I haven't.

But this movie has a lot of good stuff going on, and it's great to see a movie like this come out.  I'm not sure if it's because the writers are getting tired of having to write a story about a movie that's not even a good movie.  I'm just not sure if it's because the writers are tired of having to write a story about a movie that's not even a good movie.  If they did, they'd give it another shot.

1,"First off, this thing is big. If you don't have an application that requires a big, long spout, this is probably not a good choice for you. I did need one because I have a large soaker tub with a wide rim and a wall mounted faucet. It was really tough to find a long wall mounted spout that wasn't really expensive. I also wanted one without a diverter, but that just wasn't going to happen, so I settled on this one and just removed the diverter. The spout itself is pretty solid and installation was easy. You can install it in three ways: 1) with a short MPT stub, 2) with a long MTP stub, or 3) with a o-ring-sealed slip fit. My only complaint is that the quality of the finish is not great. There are visible cross-hatch marks in the finish. It's not scratched (if it was I would have returned it for a replacement). It appears to be just the way these are made - the metal is not getting polished to a sufficient degree. Unless you're a perfectionist like me, this probably won't bother you, but I wanted to mention it."

So I brought it to him when he was sitting down and gave it to him and he suprisingly ate it but ate it too quickly and threw half of it up. That was enough for me and I threw the rest of them in the garbage.

1,"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.

The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.

they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

Overall i am very happy with this purchase. met all expectations."

1,"I rented this DVD only out of curiosity because I had heard of this often overlooked sci-fi entry made by Mario Bava. To be honest, given its' B-movie status, I was expecting a rather one dimensional gore-fest.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.

Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.

An interplanetary crew from Earth, answering a distress signal from another planet, land and get more than they bargained for. Very smart, underplayed and scary.

At times I felt I was watching an episode of a well done Star Trek entry.

Very well done. Worth the rental."

1,"Habits we all have them, we all use them  but we all don't know why or how.

Yet our habits, many would say, rule us. They are powerful factors in what we do, in who we are,  They influence our buying habits. guide us through complex actions such as driving a car all without the hint of a thought on our part. And that's a blessing for we could not possibly think of every detail  of every task we have to do. Habits are our overdrive mechanism.

This book explores  the power of our habits and how we can change them in ourselves,  in the work place and in society.

A full forty percent of what we do every day is predicated on engrained habits. Our responses particularly to mundane activities are automatic, don't require any thinking and fall into routines, one triggering another. The process provides comfort and thus we keep repeating them.
Even if the habit reinforces bad behavior, its comfort zone reinforces our behavior.

The book is replete with examples of how clever people manipulated our habits or created new ones in us to have us support a particular sports team, buy Pepsodent or Febrez. All accomplished subconsciously on a hapless public. A thoughtful reading of this book could make you a more sophisticated consumer.

A chapter entitled ""The Golden Rule of Habit Change"" provides pragmatic advice not only on discovering your hidden habits but how to intervene to change them.  The author provides many examples of persons who did just that.  Their stories are downright inspiring."

It took her less than two minutes to figure out how to pull her toes into the seat, push down on the float and stand up, which caused her to fall head first into the water. If you cant have eyes on your baby every second (I have two older children I need to watch too) this float is not safe once your baby can stand.

This float would be great for younger children and I would have given it four stars if it hadn't been advertised for children through 2 years old.  I would say it is best for children 5 months to walking. The product description should also explain that the outer ring must be inflated. I thought it had a foam ring."
1,"I couldn't finish. It was painfully one-dimensional to me: the reader was told how to feel about every character and situation from the beginning (I tried to let it slide, because beginnings can be rocky even with great stories).
Fav part was when the Hero was talking to an evil henchman, and he yells, ""How much are they paying you?"" And the henchman replies some amount that means nothing to me, and the Hero says, ""It's not enough,"" and flies into a confident, low-stakes martial-arts butt-kicking, somehow never revealing his face. It might actually be cooler and more believable the way I described it. So cheesy!
Then I got bored: erotic dreams of characters who have no emotional attachment to each other doesn't interest me at all, especially because I'm not attached to either of these characters. I was rolling my eyes about their lusty waking inner-monologues, too. And then our Hero was thinking about masturbating on and off for three pages and there's no chance of this ever feeling romantic to me. Might as well tell me his tragic backstory of bowel movements."

1,"This book is at times cute, at times witty, and at times heartbreaking.  The story of two aimless brothers and their boring, pointless lives in Reno, ""Motel Life"" is a solid read.  Tragedy sets the two brothers on a road trip together, but this is no buddy story about bonding while traveling.  It is one character's realization that his life is going nowhere and that he needs to find a way to change that before he gets to the point where his rut is inevitable.  Along the way, his brother is going through a journey of his own, full of guilt and fear and desperation for his role in a terrible accident.

With great descriptions of Reno (a place I've never been) and the surrounding areas, ""Motel Life"" is a character piece first.  What it lacks in plot it makes up for in enjoyable dialogue and great, well-rounded characters."

With most dropper posts running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike was only around $900. I did tons of research, read lots of reviews, and ended up stumbling across this dropper.

So far i don't have a single complaint about this post. I've been riding it for about a month and a half now and It actuates very smoothly, quickly, and reliably. The only drawbacks to this post that i can see are the amount of travel it offers (100mm compared to many droppers with 125mm, i personally find 100mm to be plenty), the quality of the button (its not bad, the LEV just has a nicer, ODI compatable one), and the left/right saddle wiggle (which is 100% unnoticeable when riding).

I would suggest the KS eTen to ANYONE looking for a quality dropper post without breaking the bank.

Pros
-Quality
-Reliable
-Cheap

Possible Cons
-Travel (opinion)
-Speed (opinion)

This story continues with us still trying to determine who the killer is.  As we watch Kate come into herself as a submissive, Jaxon is just the one to show her how much pleasure giving up control can be.  Their relationship continues to be steamy and hot.

Kate is falling fast for Jaxon.  She doesnt want to have her heart broken when they finally locate the killer and Jaxon moves on from her.  But she is willing to play along so that she can be close to him.  As they continue to look for the killer, Kate still can not deny that she has feelings for her boss, Nate.  Nate seems to feel that he needs to protect her too.

We learn more about the relationship that Jaxon and his wife had in the club.  There are more secrets discovered that may help lead us to the true killer.  few more pieces of the puzzle fall into place, there is a major danger issue for Kate.  Someone is out to get her.  They have found her true identity.  She does not share this with Nate or Jaxon.  She is determined to keep her past a secret.

This was an amazing book in the series.  I can not wait to jump into book 3."
1,"Having just watched McFarland USA with Costner which I think was a good movie, it was tough for me not to compare the two movies and Costners portrayals a bit. Costners plays his flawed character well although his portrayal feels a bit more subdued than I expected. To me though Estill, who played the little girl Eloise, really played her role well. This is a movie that tries to tell a story that is a shade of gray and not clear cut with everyone involved having some character flaws of their own. There are some emotional moments but at times the movie feels a bit flat and slow moving and the story failed to really connect me to the characters and pull me at the heartstrings that I expected it to do so. It almost seemed to me that they tried too hard to be a bit grey in their story at times with the lack of character development that made it feel a bit superficial. Maybe it was because I watched McFarland USA and I am comparing this too much, I don't know. This is not a bad movie by any means as it is a good family movie that can start a conversation but it does seem to lack something that could make it more. 3 to 3."

1,"Even if someone gives you The Swede for free, it's not worth your time.  The book comes highly recommended, and it's a Scandinavian thriller, so I was ready to enjoy reading it from beginning to end.  Unfortunately, the plot is poorly constructed and impossible to believe (even for a summer book), and the one-dimensional characters made it a real struggle just to finish.  (To be fair, Ben - the gay lover, is interesting.)

The anti-American tone didn't bother me, but the lack of subtlety or cleverness certainly did.  Here's a sample sentence:  ""Like other Americans, he jingled coins in his pocket and constantly asked for more ice in his drinks.""  Shouldn't the author (or translator) have used ""some"" or ""many"" instead of ""other?""  Is it really possible that every American fits this description?

But that's far less important than the bad plot and characters.  Take my advice, and skip this one."

For the price it offers a lot of features and works really well.  The light is easy to install, just need your basic power/neutral and ground wire. The electrical box I was installing it into was tiny, but it fit.  I did wrap the outlet terminal screws with 2 layers of electical tape for added protection.

The screw terminal are the stab and screw kind, they seem to bite into the wire and hold it well. The child protection is smooth, I have other outlets where you have to use some force to plug something in, this outlet does not have that problem.

The dimming feature is really awesome and simple to use, really couldn't ask for more.  There is a short delay for the night light to turn on, another reviewer said dark pants set it off, not sure how that is happening."

1,"I enjoy trying out new technology all the time, but it's not that often a piece of new technology really impresses me!! The Roku player has done that - easy to set up, works exactly like advertises and actually has exceeded my expectations. Super high quality image, easy to use. And a great price at that.

The only thing I wish this device would do is access and stream music and videos from my home computer.  Then I'd have one device that does it all.

Highly recommended."
1,A wonderful story for anyone coping with a tragedy or just trying to understand the meaning of their own life. I would love to see this as a required reading for religious education.

Fit and feel great.  Not too tight or too loose. "

1,"I added on a garage and office to my house years ago and put the light switches in the wrong area. They were hard to reach. This solved the problem.  What can I say.. it works.. I used one ( low wattage) incandescent bulb trick and all my other ""green"" lights work fine without flicker."
1,"Bluetooth connection is spotty and cuts out intermittently, especially when walking or even stopped at an interception waiting for the crosswalk, it can completely cut out for up to twenty seconds. Phone is in my pocket the whole time, not more than 2ft away from the device. Not sure if it's other devices interfering with it, or if the Bluetooth is constantly wasting itself trying to connect to nearby devices even when it's already connected to yours, but whatever the case,the Bluetooth connection is horrible."

It was so interesting because it always covered one dispatcher and one firefighter and their one on one relationship.

0,I have the colossal crate that has the wide opening. I will keep this for the next couple of months. Great crate! I will definitely order another one.I'm a very picky cat and this shampoo is amazing. I've used it for years and it still works. I also love that it's a natural scent and it doesn't smell like a perfume. It also doesn't make my cats smell like I do. I'm really glad I got this product because I'm not sure if I'll be buying another one.I've been using this product for about a year now and it has really helped my dog. She's a finicky eater. We bought this for her as a Christmas gift and we're using it for her Christmas present.

0,"It has been 5 months and it still works well. I will keep this in mind when buying.I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase.  The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life.  He also likes it.  I have the phone in the charger, and it is a little longer than I expected.  This is not a big deal for him, but it is annoying for me.  I have to get my phone to charge.  I am very happy with this purchase.I'm a huge fan of the Sony Walkman HD.  I've used it for over a year, and I still love it.  The only issue is that I can't get it to read my files.  I can't even get it to read my pictures.  I wish it had a USB port, but I don't think I will ever get it.  I can't get it to read my photos on the computer, but I can get it to read them on the TV.  I have a DVD player, and it works fine.  But it is too small for my needs.  It is not a good size for traveling, and it would be better if it were bigger.  The included USB adapter is small enough that I could carry it with"
1,I love this pillow! I no longer have any neck or back pain! Thank you! It keeps it's form and never goes flat.
1,"The price is the key here. I bought these a month ago and finally got to use them. The bags are a little bit ""slipperier"" if that makes sense and the roll doesn't fit in the area meant for bags. I knew this prior to purchase.... but it is inconvenient to cut them by hand. I guess I will roll some out so they do fit. I would recommend though without question for the price alone!

*****Updated Review***** These are horrible. Do NOT buy them! Here I am months later and realizing that the cheap imitations don't last. You seal your food. It looks fine/like it worked. And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold. I resealed at least 10 packages yesterday that I noticed had a gap/room inside. One package actually had freezer burn. So in the long run this item was DEFINITELY NOT worth it!"
1,"The only puppy food we will buy from here on out! Our Australian shepherd puppy has a  beautiful coat! She loves her food, and it seems to digest extremely well. No issues at all!"
0,Runs about a size too small. The wide width is too narrow.
1,This was just okay.  Totally unrealistic but entertaining.  It was free so I am not complaining. The cover was enticing.

0,"These are truly great lights.  I love the long bulb, its easy to install, and the extra light output.  The only thing I can say is that the bulb is very bright.  It is still very attractive, I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken one I had.  I love the color and the fact that the hose is a little longer than I expected.  This one has a nice white finish.  I like that the hose is longer than the one I had.  The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean.  I am really happy with this purchase.

The only thing I can say is that if you are looking for a quality speaker, look no further.  This is one of the best speaker cables you can find.  I highly recommend this cable to anyone who wants a great sound system.I've had this for about a year now and I love it."
1,"These are made well, they don't leak one bit, I'm very happy with this purchase. I would buy again. Don't hesitate to buy. Great seal on the inside."
1,"Surprisingly strong feels like it's going to last quite awhile, probably will never need another one unless I loose this one. I work armed Security so I need to have a hand cuff key on me in case I need to arrest someone. I usually carry 4 keys on me but this one is the most convenient and easiest to get too when I need it. If you're a Cop, Security, Corrections, etc I would recommend you buy one of these."
0,"They are very cute, but the stretchy design is just too thin. I have a hard time finding a pair of the same size,"
1,Excellent story based in England during WWII that runs the gamete of emotions. It deals with a young girl and her life. I enjoyed watching it and I could watch it again.

1,"Got my wife the Kindle FIRE for the holiday and she is the type of person that needs a case and she loves green.  This was the only green case I could find for the FIRE, but it has been absolutely awesome.  It is almost like a faux leather and she loves it.  More importantly, it has kept her Kindle safe from scratches an dings!"
1,"I do not order articles of clothing unless I have tried them on in person. I have a difficult time finding clothes that fit. I decided to order this dress and crossed my fingers. I have never been more surprised at the fit!

I ordered the black dress with a red edge/outline on the neck and bow. The dress arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime. It was packaged in a plastic bag. I definitely would recommend upgrading to the gift-wrapping service if you are sending this dress as a gift.

I removed the dress from the package and was happy that I did not smell anything weird. I worry with less expensive items that they smell like chemical. This is not the case with this dress.

The dress is an excellent fit. I cannot believe how good of a fit. I normally wear a 12 (US) and I ordered the XL. I also was happy that I can wear my normal bras with this dress and the straps do not show, seriously, look at the pictures. The bra is not visible!

I am happy with the purchase so far but will update this review if there is an issue. I may only use this a couple hours on a date night so use is infrequent.

I am not connected in any way to this company but I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. I use reviews myself when shopping online and I hope this is useful information for you. Don't hesitate to ask questions and I will update if there is a problem in the future. Please see attached pictures if you would like to see the coolness factor up close."

0,Been using it for about a month and the only thing I did not like is the screen has a slight lag.  The screen is a bit brighter than the original version of the headset but it's not noticeable.  The sound is very good.  I use it on a lot of Skype calls.  I also use it with a tablet and the audio is very clear.  I have had no problems with it.  I am very happy with it.This is a great product for the price. It works as expected. I use it with my ipod and it works very well. The sound is great. I do not have a problem with my car. I am very happy with it.I got this to replace an older wall mount for my tv.  It is a great fit and the only thing I would change is the screws to hold the tv down.  It was very easy to install and works great. I would recommend this
0,"This was an interesting story, but the characters were just too real. There were too many of the same clichs that I've seen before. The characters were just so real, and that made it difficult to put them down.I enjoyed this book. I don't know how I would recommend it to anyone but I will say that I had to wait a bit for the second book. I just didn't care for it as much as the first one. It's very sad that this book is ending. I hope the series continues.I loved this book"
0,"These are industry-standard hinges, but some have problems with the latch mechanism.  These work well and the latch is so small that it's difficult to attach the hinges to the door.  The hinges are spaced well enough so that the door can be closed without disturbing the door.  The hinge is not a"
1,"You're little one will probably want this regardless, but note that for the price, this is more of an accessory rather than a pony play house.  There aren't any places to really play inside - it's more about playing dressup with the included pony, which includes shoes, skirt, crown.

The set assembles fairly easily and for the most part stays together.  We use it more as a decoration to store her ponies on the shelf nicely. Since it is so flat, the ponies can go in front of it.

The 'bridge' stays down without the other palace playset and is unusable - kind of silly not to have it at least be a ramp up."
0,"This is a wonderful Agatha Christie novel, with a lot of twists and turns. I was sad to find out that the story had ended.  The ending was a bit of a surprise, but it was still a good ending.I enjoyed this book. I don't know how I would recommend it to anyone but I will say that I had to wait a bit for the ending.

1,"We have a farm, chores rain or shine.  It is so nice to always have dry boots to put on since we got this dryer!  It does a much better job than just setting boots by the fireplace or heater, it dries them quickly from the inside."
1,"Great movie (in Dutch) about how things can so easily spin out of control.  So believable, so painful.  They give us great music and then kill it, a metaphor for how those whose heads expand so much that they kill everything, right Alabama?"

He uses it for golf practice and it works well for him.  It is very comfortable to wear, and can be worn on his forearm.  He will probably just wear it with golf clubs as it is very useful.

1,"I'm not generally a fan of doing something that is negative reinforcement for my dogs, as I don't believe that 's really what works.  However, my poms were out of control when I went on walks, barking at every person or dog that we passed.  They really just wanted to say hello, but people would think they weren't friendly.  I needed something that would stop that behavior, and this worked well.  It only took a few times of using it, and now I can just show them the can, and they'll stop.  It just emits the sound of compressed air, which they don't enjoy.  It fits easily in my pocket to keep handy for when I need it.  If you've tried other things and need something that really works, this is worth a try."
0,Perfect size and rugged.  Not an easy case to break but it fits my iPad perfectly.

1,Love the Glide 8. Happy they didn't change too much from the Glide 7.
1,"This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on."
0,"There is detailed information about the history and the relationship between the two main characters, the strong and the weak. The story is well written and the characters are well developed. The chemistry between the main characters is great and the chemistry between the secondary characters is great. The story is short and sweet and a bit sweet at times, but it is sweet and sweet and sweet at the same time. I was given a copy of this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review. I have read all of her books and I really enjoyed them. They were so well written and the characters were believable. They were definitely different but they were still enjoyable."
1,I love these sheets and just bought a second set for my son.  Very soft and they hold up great.
1,"This book is hot! Can you imagine that you can carry the child that can reunite a planet? The catch is you will have 3 mates, who happen to be identical triplets wowzers!

1,"This is a steamy story of two people who have a working relationship without complete communication.  They are boss, Mr. Pettifor and assistant, Ms. Darcy. They share a sexual relationship that is hot and obviously satisfying to both.  Unfortunately, since they do not talk, misunderstandings lead to rash decisions. This was a quick but satisfying read!

1,"My cat needed lysine - but she didn't like it in any form (capsule mixed into her food, gel, chew).  This one was the best - she will eat it sometimes, if I break it into 2-3 pieces, unlike the vet's chews, which cost a good deal more and were completely rejected.  This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much)."

0,"Great quality. Except for the small size, the cord is thick enough to hold my iPad and the speaker is so small that it's not worth mentioning. The plastic part on the side is nice, and it's not too stiff to be used. If you're looking for a cord that is long enough to fit a larger iPad, I would recommend this one. I haven't had any problems with the cord, but I'm sure it won't last as long as the other ones.I got this for my son's old laptop.  He loved it and it was great!

1,"There are several sized baskets among the reviews here; this is a review of the one they call the Medium.

The inside dimensions excluding the rounded top lip are just shy of 5-1/2"" wide by 15-1/2"" long by 5-3/4"" tall. The lip adds another 1/4"" to each side and the top thus the overall 6"" wide, 6"" deep and 16"" long in the specifications.

This is a nice sturdy basket, attractive, well made. It has sides which are pretty straight. Why is that important?

I'm picky but for a reason. Those with straight sides are better for organizing; the more slant on the sides of a basket the more it will take up excess room over the usable area, wasting storage space. You see too many of that kind on the market.

This basket joins numerous others being used to organize my refrigerator and freezer; everything in its place makes everything easy to find."

It does a good job of keeping my coffee hot. I've had no problems with the drip mechanism, the coffee is not hot as I'd expected. It's not really a bad product, I was just disappointed in the way it was shipped. I bought a couple of small boxes of the coffee maker and was very pleased with the results.

1,I chose this on a recommendation from a reliable friend. In the beginning I had hope this book would become more likable.  I trudged through to the end.  I could not identify with any of the characters.  I was not sympathetic to any of the main characters.  Don't waste your time.

1,"I just received this book 10 minutes ago so I am unable to comment on how thoroughly it covers the basics. It appears to have a lot of detail on how to use the program.

However, be warned it is only a ""user"" guide, it has absolutely no ""tech"" info such as information on how to install or upgrade. If you have a previous version of Quickbooks and want to know any gotcha's about what happens to your data while upgrading (or how to get your data migrated into the new version) this is not the guide. If you are concerned about advanced topics such as 64-bit systems or server-based versus desktop-based or how to lock it down so everyone in the company doesn't have to be a super-user just to use the software this type of information does not appear to be in this book. There is some coverage on managing users in chapter 26 but little on how to make multi-user work so more than one person can use the software at a time and what the issues/limitations are,

In summary - if you have already got your computer guy/gal to install and set it up for you, this looks to be the right book for you. If you have an unopened box or are trying to understand what the install instructions mean, it is not and you will need additional info."
1,Liberty is a wonderful character and this is a wonderful story. In I Will Breathe by Regina Puckett we find ourselves 800 years into the future in the remnants of a war-ravaged world. There we meet Liberty aboard Airus and suddenly we are captivated by a well crafted story and a small robot. Loved it. Five stars.
1,"I purchases this as an alternative to pricier hammocks. I also own hammocks from Grand Trunk and ENO. The fabric on the Yukon is a very nice ""crumply"" parachute fabric. It is more comfortable and breathable than the standard nylon on my Grand Trunk ultralight. Where Yukon cuts corners is in the cordage and carabiner. They use standard hardware-store type materials. I am please for the price I paid (under $25). But if I was comparing a full price version of this hammock to a full-priced ENO, I'd go for the ENO. I will probably change out the hardware down the road, as it adds a lot of weight to the overall package. Overall, I'm happy for the price I paid."
0,"I use my iPhone to go to the movies and watch movies on my iPhone. I have one in my bedroom.  The other is in the bathroom where I use the phone.  The screen is crisp and clear.  I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV securely. The only con I've noticed is that it has a small gap where it attaches to the wall. I haven't seen it in action yet. I would recommend it to anyone.I have been using a gb for years and I can tell you that it's a quality product.  I bought the gb for the price of $70.  It's not the best quality but it's pretty good.  I've had it for a few months and it's not bad.  The only complaint I have is that it's not very durable and it's very hard to replace.  I'm very satisfied with the purchase.works greatI bought this for my wife because she loves the Samsung Galaxy Tab S.  I had a little trouble getting it to work.  It is a little bulky and uncomfortable, but I love it.  I use it as a stand for my camera.  It works great.  I also like that the battery life is much shorter than the standard sized battery. "
1,"Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy."
1,"PROS:
1. This allows you to get ""flatter"" against your work, so it's critical for certain tasks.
CONS:
1. Very cheaply constructed, and doesn't last long.  You'll need to replace these regularly.
2. Runs very hot and noisy.
3. Very difficult to install and remove from the main unit.  Not something you can just swap on and off easily.
TIPS:
1. Don't run it too fast, or for too long.  Let it cool off from time to time.
2. When installing and removing shafts (the rod with the disc at the end), insert a spare shaft through the hole near the tip of the angle attachment, to prevent the main shaft from turning while you tighten or loosen it.  If you use the button that's built-in to the main tool, you'll strip the gears in the right-angle attachment."

1,"I wanted to use it with my TV. Basically use a Bluetooth headphone with a TV. Once you connect to a bluetooth device you can hear this background humming sound. I'm very sure that its from this device and not the bluetooth headphones. I use the headphones very regularly. The humming sounds I suppose can be ignored because once the sound starts playing you don't hear it. But then there is a delay in the sound. I think it's about half a second (or maybe 300ms) which is pretty bad. Bad enough that you can't really watch TV like that. Considering the quality of sound, the delay and the background humming, its not worth the price.

I haven't tried other products so I don't know if this is a standard problem with all Bluetooth Tx."

The way she treated the bullies and other women that came into her life was just ridiculous. The one thing I really liked about the story was the way it kept you guessing. I could see why the author felt it was a little over-the-top for the most part. I think that's why I like"

I will update to see if any develops, but I cant imagine it happening since its so solid."
0,"Well, I am a big fan of the wide-angle lenses.  These have a wide angle view and are not the best for most situations.  The plastic body makes it difficult to slip it in and out of the lens without damaging it.  This lens is excellent for those situations.  The 2.5x zoom is also fantastic.  The auto focus is so fast that it is very easy to pull off a few items and still get the focus down.  The zoom is also very good, although I have noticed that the zoom range is not as good as I hoped.  I am really impressed with this lens and recommend it to others.This is a very good sound system. I have been using it for about 3 years and I can tell you that it works perfectly. My only gripe is the battery life is not as good as my other speaker system. I have a Samsung phone that I have been using for about a month now and I can tell you that the battery life is just not as good as my system. I would definitely recommend this"
1,"I use this with the larger size bowl, but the smaller one makes a nice extra cup for my purse or glove department. With the bottle, it does bounce on my leg while walking, but not enough that I notice it. It's really nice to use on a walk.

06/15/15 I'm changing my rating from five stars to three because the water bottle now falls out of the loop. I guess I've used it enough that the hole has stretched and it bounces enough that the water bottle works its way out of the holder and falls. I've tried just taking a half full bottle, and it still falls out. This started out really nice, but now won't work for me.

Maybe if attached to something that doesn't bounce as much, such as a knapsack, it would still work fine. But I only use a fanny pack when walking my dog, so it's attached to that."
1,"The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.
 I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store."

But I needed something to wear for this weekend's family cookout that was not stretch pants. I'm maybe somewhere between a medium and a large right now. I got 3 sizes, I figured I can try all on keep the one that fits and return the other two. The medium fits like an extra small, the large fits like a small, I kept the xL and it fits like a large. They have an elastic waistband which is wonderfully comfortable especially if you have a little extra tummy and they are high waisted which also adds to the comfort. They are very flattering , they don't squeeze your legs. These are a HUGE WINNER for any size woman These saved me for my weekend cookout . Thinking of buying more colors."

1,"We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker."
1,"I learned how to do the rubix cube a few years back but I hated how the stickers kept falling off, plus I wanted to try a speed cube. I am no expert at speed cubing but just going from a basic cube to this speed cube was a huge improvement on my time. This is a lot easier to maneuver. I use this cube at least once a week and haven't had any problems with it.

My daughter took this into her room once and came back out with a few pieces that came off. It was easy to put them back on. I can only think she tried to force it when one of the sides was slightly misaligned and that's what led to the pieces coming off but I haven't had that issue.

I spend $20 bucks on the original rubix cube at some planetarium so I was happy to find this better version for half the price."

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way. After 2 months of trying to make it work (because it was SO expensive), he gave up and returned to his old pillow. I then took up the cause (because it was SO expensive) and tried to make it work.
  - There is not a slant from either side that is comfortable for your neck
  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to snoring
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your back (my husband)

So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

1,"Okay first off this is not a LOSi product quality bash review because we all know LOSI makes quality cars. This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it."

1,"I have used these tops as basics for years now. I love them. I like this one in particular because it's not as thin a material as other white t-shirt/basic layering shirts can be. Some of us get to an age where we don't need to show off our undergarments for all to see. This shirt helps me do that. It is form fitting. I usually wear Large/10-12. I ordered this in a Large. It is not tight, but it hugs to the body just as the photo shows. Every curve is visible. It makes for a great alternative to a sexy t-shirt style for over 40's. Paired with nice jewelry and good jeans, you'll look great on a night out."

1,"I typically read the negative reviews before I buy something.  This review primarily addresses some of the negative reviews.  I've owned a black one for about 18 months and it is by far my favorite light weight jacket.  I have a camel color on order.  Some say it's larger than what the size label says...  Well, one needs to realize it is a ""golf"" jacket.  Hence, it is extra roomy in just the right areas for a golfer to take a full swing and not feel inhibited.  The medium I own fits like a medium should in the jacket and arm lengths, and the shoulder seams are exactly where they should be.  I have worn this jacket with a polo shirt and it's roomy, but fine.  I've also worn it with two layers of tee shirts and a sweatshirt, and went golfing...  It was great!  Regarding quality issues...  I have worn this jacket at least 250 days over the past 18 months and it shows no signs of wear.  I owned a London Fog overcoat many years ago, and the pocket stitching started unraveling after about 1 year; I sent it to London Fog (I paid for shipping) and they sent me a new overcoat (they paid for shipping).  Three inside pockets...  one on each breast and a lower one for a cell phone.  I've carried a Kindle in one breast pocket, a 7 inch tablet in the other breast pocket (both with protective cases) and my cell phone in the lower inside pocket, and keys and other miscellaneous things in the outside pockets.  I was weighed down a bit, but it worked great, particularly if one is traveling in a foreign country (very secure)."

Almost instant results happened for me. I started feeling better and happier after the first run through. I noticed weight begin to slip off little by little and suddenly I was at my pre baby weight in two weeks! I get that results like that are not too common, but stress was holding the weight on me and Zumba really helped my stress levels.

Some will find the historical illustrations thin while others may find the analysis provided a stretch in place, but Nassiar Ghaemi has published one interesting book.  Ghaemi is the director of the Mood Disorder Program at Tuft Medical School.  Using available historical and medical evidence, he argues that various mood disorders can be  linked to success in leadership situations.  In individual sections he takes up creativity, realism, empathy, and resilience.  He finally takes up treatment and mental in general.  Along the way, he illustrates his views using the lives of well known persons including Bush, Blair, Nixon, JFK, Roosevelt, Martin Luther King, Lincoln Churchill.  Just the character sketches that Ghaemi uses is worth the price of the book.  This is one of the more thought provoking books that I have read in the past couple of years.  Readers will approach leadership differently after completing this volume."

1,"Well I've had this installed for a few months. Ended up purchasing 6 more dimmers. The HomeKit interface is great. The overall quality has met my expectations for the current products on the market. My biggest tangible complaint is the wall switches have a cheap feel. The remotes feel more sturdy and less wobbly when you press the buttons. The app works well on the iPhone and watch. Siri is a bonus but Apple needs to work on their side of the integration a little more. Most of the time I can use Siri quickly for dimming or turning the lights on. The app needs some improvement with the geo location. I added my girlfriend to the app. However, I have the app programmed to turn the lights off when I leave. If my girlfriend is home it still turns them off. Not big deal but this would be a pain if you have a big family. You can easily turn this feature off if you don't like it. Lutron if you're listening please keep improving the app and hub integration with other products. Bonus points if you program an alarm clock dimmer. Overall, the best you can get for the price and quality level. 5 stars based on that fact. The reality is its more of a 4."
1,"What a stinker! I am a lover of horror films and I really regret buying this film. The trailer makes it look decent and some of the reviews gave it a pretty positive rating so I figured it might be good; I was wrong. This is nothing like Creepshow or any other decent anthology. I lacks atmosphere and feels very rushed. The entire film feels like they just didn't care. The effects may have been decent if they were used properly but they are poorly utilized here. I was hopeful when I saw some of the cast and writer/directors associated with this, esp. using Adrienne Barbeau (sp), the narrator from the Fog and actress in allot of decent horror flix like the original Creepshow, Escape from New York, and others, but  but it was a trust misplaced. I realized my mistake in purchasing this film within minutes and so will you if you are foolish enough to pay for this movie. Wait for it to be free on Amazon or Netflix if you must watch it, but be warned, it isn't even worth watching for free!"

At that point I had been too young to know the movie, aged by the time I was born, but when I saw it thought, wow, that's it.  With R Burton and E Taylor playing opposite, and caught on film, there was simply no reason to try it again.  I still wonder when anyone does.

These little devices are the same for line voltage connectors as Nichols and team were to Albee's play.  The technology has gone as far as it can.  They cost something, but just after my first installation I'm tempted to run around the house, opening and updating every junction box I can find.  If you take on minor electrical work around your own house, buy these and love them."
1,"If you've got a kid who is building cars in the garage they might be okay putting this together, but I'm thinking it's more for adults, both because the game Destiny is not a kid's game, and because there are some very small parts and somewhat complex instructions. At any rate, I would recommend the builder be at least 10-12 years old depending on skill level.

My wife got this and was overjoyed to begin putting it together. She found the instructions a bit frustrating at times, but had it put together in a few days with no help from me, and she's never really done anything like this before so she was surprised that she took to it so well (she really just wanted the finished product but seemed to get really into the building process from my perspective).

There are extra parts that come with the model, and the finished product is mighty cool (though a bit subdued in color, but that's Destiny for you). When you are done you'll have a nice block model to display but I wouldn't recommend ""playing with it"" unless you want to see fragile broken pieces all over your house.

Recommended for Destiny fans who are also builders with moderate skill and enjoy assembling models. Worth the price if building models like this is your thing."

1,"Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read."

Original Review:
Well I have had this camera for 1.5 years and have to say it takes amazing pictures.
It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brands and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere.
Fits well into small bags, purses etc

Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one.....
There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... has been a nightmare...... sigh!!
I wasted tons of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size.
Tried a few camera stores and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded....
That means I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap.
What a ""post-purchase"" drag this has been!
Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brands now that have more main stream camera parts so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle......
You've lost all my future business on this Sony....."

She is still struggling with the loss of her son. This book is a great read for young people.I loved this book!  I can't wait to read the next one!I received a free copy of this book from the author for my honest review.

This book was very interesting to me. It is the first book I've read by this author, and I was very interested in it. It is definitely a different take on the characters of the first book. I was very curious about this book, and it has it all. I can't wait to see what happens with the other characters.

The story is well-written, and the characters are well-developed. I enjoyed the story a lot. I thought the author did a good job of setting the mood of the characters and the story. I was very pleased with the way the author handled the emotions of the characters. I'm very pleased to see that the author added a couple of new characters to the story.

I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can use it as a pad if you need to put a lot of weight on it. I like that it is a little thicker than my other pants. I like that it is easier to store your belt. It is more comfortable than I thought it would be. I don't have to worry about the buckle getting stuck. I like that it does not get stuck while I'm walking. I like that it does not have a strap that can be removed. The other pants I have have had trouble with it getting stuck. I have had problems with it getting stuck in the bag while I was walking. I can't say much about that because I haven't had any problems with it getting stuck.

The story follows the family of Rosanna Tarr, who was a high school drop out who was just a teenager when she was found murdered.  She was found murdered at the apartment of a wealthy man and was found hanging on the side of a building.  Rosanna's family was shocked and initially it was believed that she had been murdered.

1,"This pelican is bright, cheery, and the perfect ""huggable"" size for my 1 year old.  The small animals/food for the pelican is equally bright, and each one has a different tactile response.  The purpose of the toy is for the baby to ""feed"" the small animals to the pelican.  The child has to really push the animals in, because the toys tend to get stuck in the pelican's throat, but I chalk that up to helping develop fine motor skills.  The only issue I have with this toy is that the opening in the belly is large enough that the little animals will just fall out on their own.  In fact, while my 2 year old twins enjoy playing with the pelican the ""right"" way, my just turned 1 year old prefers to stuff the little animals straight into the pelican's belly.  There is also ties on the top of the bird to allow it to be tied to crib rails or a play yard - at least according to the directions.  Personally, I would not tie the toy to the rails of a crib, because by the time a child reaches the designated age to play with this toy (9months - 3years) anything tied to the crib could be potentially be used as a step.  However, we keep it in the toy box, and it gets played with off and on all day long. Overall I'm very pleased with this toy."

It made his behavior much worse- he would throw temper tantrums and just lie down on the walk, refusing to get up. After many adjustments, he was still able to get the nose part off every time.

After a few days of play, she still couldn't figure out what was going on. After some play, she knew what was going on. I did get a ""plastic box"" for her to fill up with Lego pieces, but I had to go to the store and buy a cardboard box for her to fill up with her Lego. The box was already empty and I was thinking she was going to get a box filled with Lego pieces. The next day, she opened the box and found a box filled with Lego pieces. She then opened another box filled with Lego pieces and found a box filled with Lego pieces. It took her a few hours to fill up the box and she was on her way. I was very happy with the product and I was glad to see she could do it herself. The Lego pieces are durable and she could easily build her own Lego blocks. I would definitely recommend this product.

Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. )
Anyhow the backpack stood up to the 10 day trip and it's ready now for an other trip that I'm planning. I am considering buying the Ospray 105 only because I'm a big guy and it would fit me better."

1,"This is one of the best books I've read this year. The story is compelling, the characters excellently written, and it deals so very, very well with the intrinsic power imbalance in any relationship involving slavery.

The romance is a slow burn by necessity, but is very much secondary to the storyline until it's really thrown in James' face what he's been doing all this time. Watching him have to re-evaluate everything he's understood in his life and slowly struggle with new insights (and that he might not be as good a man as he's thought) is the real story of the book, despite the high fantasy surrounding it. And it's wonderful, staying compelling without dragging through too much navel-gazing."
1,"I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

I recommend and do like the no zip.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't store the stroller folded and standing upright.  Perhaps I'll need to get a luggage strap to wrap around."

1,"I enjoyed the story, but her books always touch my heart and this one fell a little short. And every time the TV show was mentioned Gut It! was used--very distracting. Also, the name of the show was jarring. I picture ""gutting"" a deer, not a home. HGTV has shows like Generation Renovation, Fixer Upper, Rehab Addict. Ms. Delinsky should have taken her cue from those names. But she still remains one of my favorite authors in this genre."
1,"Loved the movie, but it left a bad (director (Besson), and so called visual effects) after taste.
The first BIG downer, was when Lucy was repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a drug czars henchmen, when they knew the very expensive drugs where inside her belly; REALLY?  The next blunder was on the part of the so-called visual effects people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody uses it anymore. REALLY?
I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY?
Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, as it was not well spent on the production.
Compare this with the 2012 The Avengers, at 220mil/143 min running time, and you can see it was a low budget film from the start, and for that reason, they actually did a pretty good job."

1,"Not since ""Plata Quemada"" has Argentina made such an amazing movie.  Soul-wrenching storytelling and amazing cinematography make this a must-see for anyone.  There's a camera angle in this movie, though perhaps helped by computer, begins high over a soccer (football) stadium, pans down over the field, beyond the goal, into the screaming crowd before focusing on one face, then follows the ""owner of the face"" down into the bowels of the stadium itself...SEAMLESSLY.  Not that the amazing camera work is the best thing about it, but I remember the first time I saw the movie thinking about that as it was happening.  Anyway, back to the story...it's epic.  Told somewhat in flashback, it covers over 30 years in the life of a government employee whose life was altered dramatically over choices made in his youth.  I can't tell you anymore of the plot, but I can tell you that you should definitely SEE THIS MOVIE!!  It's well worth it."

However, nothing like this was achieved in ""Heartbreaker"". My feelings concerning this book are very mixed. There were good moments and I sometimes even smiled at the one or the other verbal attack. But the story never really ""took off"".  Maybe this was because the ""chemistry"" between Nick and Laurant didn't really work?  Maybe the story line was just poor and badly elaborated?

I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. I am using this to hook up my HDX to a computer. It works fine for the price and I would recommend it to anyone.

Honestly more durable than expected which considering the price is saying a whole lot.

I could nitpick about lil things but honestly, what you get for what you pay is keeping me from complaining.

Pair this with......

And a few lighting stands

-Soren. I liked this book, as it was a little more of a thriller than a mystery. There was a lot of intrigue and drama in the beginning, but it was pretty straight forward. -The relationship between the two main characters. This was a bit of a surprise, but it was pretty good. I did get a bit of a bit of a kick out of it, but I didn't feel like I was getting any real closure. It was a bit of a surprise to me, but I did enjoy it. -The characters. I liked them. There were a lot of characters. I really liked the way they were introduced. I liked the way they came to be. I liked how they were portrayed.

1,"For 6 month it worked quite well. Leaks after a little over a year, and is difficult to clean thoroughly. Also, it's impossible to find replacement charcoal filters that fit. I'm shopping for something with a different design.

After posting the above, I've thoroughly cleaned it, including the pump. Now it works fine. So I'm changing it to 4 stars. The reason it's still not 5 stars is the difficulty getting filters that fit properly. I had to use a spring to wedge it against one side in order to properly seal it. Otherwise the filter is just soaking in the water and not filtering anything."
1,"Nothing special here. Good inexpensive headphones that are comfortable on your
ears and head.

These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight
and yet do not fall off the head easily. Of course I am not exercising with
these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on
the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or
the dog eats them not much of a loss.

Not a bad replacement for ear-buds if you prefer a descent set of portable
headphones. On notice: a lot of ear-buds will actually reduce exterior noise better
than these cups."

1,"I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price."
1,"It's a nice enough story, but it's just a story. A really simple story presumably for beginner readers. It took me 2 minutes to read the whole book.

Each page has no more than a paragraph of large text and the adjoining page has a black and white illustration. I think the illustrations are the star of the book and probably why so many people enthuse over it. But really, there's no moral, no point, and it doesn't even make sense (how is Ferdinand the biggest and strongest bull when literally all he ever does is sit and smell flowers?)

I know it's a work for children, so I wasn't expecting much, but I was disappointed at how simple and pointless the work seems. I was expecting a book for around 4th-6th grade, not a black and white picture book. Meh.

2 stars.

1,"It seems reasonably well made, but they didn't mention that it takes a T6 bulb in the description. The body is too thin to accept anything else, e.g. a candelabra base flame bulb.

Also, the switch is next to the plug which means that to turn it off, you have to get down to the outlet where it's plugged in! Not very convenient.

It's also not really very well made. When you put a bulb in it, the socket sags so one end of the bulb is visible. Overall it's a bit flimsy."

1,"Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble."

0,"This kitchen is adorable! Here's what I love:

- The kitchen is a little large, but is so small that it's not too small for the little kids to take in. - The kitchen is in a large storage case. - The kitchen has a lot of storage space. - The kitchen has a matching plastic table with several pieces of furniture. Overall, I think this kitchen is pretty good. It's easy to clean, and the kids love to play with it. The little kids will really enjoy playing with it, and it's a great addition to their kitchen. I'll be keeping this review as a Christmas present for my kids. I have been playing with this at work for over a year now and I've had no problems. I have a little girl who loves it and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. I've had it for a few months now and it's still going strong and I'm happy to say that it's not quite as bad as I thought it would be. It's not quite as big as I thought it would be, but it's still pretty darn cute. I don't think it's going to hurt my kids, but it's a good size for a little kid.

I love the fact that it is a bit smaller than I thought. I have had trouble with the rubber on the top part of my Mossberg 990b. It has a little bit of a squall on it but it's not that big.

1,This was a nice surprise! Fits tighter in the waste but gathered a bit to hide imperfections. I normally wear a 14 in ladies or xl-(I ordered a large) this fit perfectly and could even have gone a size smaller if comfortable with a tighter fit around the waste.

Very flattering and cute-I ordered another in light blue and will definitely get more! Not the highest quality but perfect for the price!

1,"I wanted a compact rain shell for traveling; it is better to pack layers instead of carrying a big coat. This rain jacket is impenetrable to water when I run a sleeve under water, and it is completely dry afterwards. I have not used it in the rain yet.

I bought the jacket ""big"" so it could be a shell and I could layer underneath it (with a packable down coat, fleece, and/or hoodie). On its own, the jacket looks comfortable and cut nicely, but not big. I am 5'6"" 105 lbs and bought size medium for growing room (I like jackets loose anyway), but it already looks great as it is.

This jacket has features I did not expect, including elastic around the bottom hem (length comes to mid pelvis) and the around the hood for cinching. There is a mesh flap in the back for breathability. These are great features. I noticed the hood is not oversized at all. Cinched up, I think I could probably keep my face dry.

The tag on my jacket said it was $60, but I got it for less than $28; love the Amazon price! It also says it packs into itself, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I rolled it up and am using hair bands.

I dropped the rating because the color represented is not the color I received, even though I like it. ""Bright rose,"" instead of being a dark magenta as is shown, is just darker than hot pink. I'm not picky about my pinks though, so I'll wear it. This color would be cheerful on a wet day, but it will stand out in a crowd.

I look forward to using this jacket a lot in the future!"

1,"Review of Secondhand Lions
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.

Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good."
0,"Saraband is really not a good movie, as it is not a true story, but it is a story that we know about. The characters and the story are not the same, and that is what makes this movie so good. I was excited to see this movie. The acting is great. The story is the most realistic I have seen in a long time. I will watch again. Love the movie. I love the sound. It's very realistic. I highly recommend this movie. I really enjoy this movie, and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. It is definitely a good story, but it's not one I would consider a good movie for children. I would recommend it for those of us who are not concerned with the quality of the story. It's very entertaining, and I enjoyed watching it in the theater.

She wants to go home but has no idea where that might be.  As she starts driving she sees a highway sign that she thinks looks familiar so she turns on to it in the direction that she thinks might take her home.  After hours of driving she pulls up to a house she thinks is her home and knocks on the door.  The door is opened by her shocked husband and finds out shes been gone for seven months and has no memory of where shes been or why.  The next day she tells her husband that she wants to retrace her route to see where shes been and why. Now things really get strange but interesting. Its a really good plot and worth reading.

On top of this we are learning much more about the Alphas and the Asura virus. Definitely need to read these in order and just take a deep breath and enjoy.  So good."

0,3. 5 stars. A story that is both entertaining and poignant. I will keep my eyes peeled for the next book. I had to read this book to get through the first half of it. The story was well told and the characters were well developed. I would recommend this to everyone. I loved this book. I have read the entire series and can't wait to see what happens next. I love the characters and the story.
1,"This is a true ergonomic mouse. I work with computers for more than 10 hrs a day, previously I was using a logitech mouse but there was wrist pain which I started feeling. So I searched for a better one and found out this one. I should say this is a good find as I am using this one for around 4 months and no sign of that wrist pain. Also the buttons are very comfortable with an additional window button which comes very handy in day to day use. Battery wise also it is good. I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months. So you have to be very careful while putting it in the computer and taking it out, otherwise it can become like mine (see the last picture)."
0,"This is a nice set, but the pieces are a bit thin. There is a tiny piece of cardboard that sits on the wall, but that is the only part of it that is truly worth it. It is a good value, but it is not very sturdy.The kids LOVE this toy.  They have played with it for several years.  They love the sounds and the music.  It is very easy to use and the kids love it.  They love the fact that it is made of wood.  The kids will use it"

1,"I adore the 'Lord Peter' series of books by Dorothy Sayers. I found this to have a darker feel to it than most - perhaps due to the lowering skies under which it's set. The plot is, as ever, complex & well-structured, and you learn a lot on the side (if you wish) about campanology, and about what life could be like in the wet lands of Norfolk. The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn. This is a book that I've already read several times, and which I'll enjoy as much the next time I turn to it.

Incidentally, the story does not involve clothing or any form of haberdashery."

1,"Oh my gosh I was so happy to receive this ARC, in exchange for an honest review.

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books."
1,"This movie somehow went under the radar, but I caught a trailer and decided to track it down. The vampires are kind of a bat / human hybrid, and look really cool. It has plenty of action and the story got me from the start. One of the best movies I've seen in a while."

The only thing I would change is that the figures are very small.  This is a problem for most toys.  The only way to get them to fit is to use a magnifying glass.  I wish I would have known better.  But for now, I like the figures, and will be buying more of them for future sets.  I really like that they are made"
1,"After reading some other reviews I was concerned about the quality and sizing of these Creature Power suits, but I have been really happy with both.  Of course the kids (huge Wild Kratts fans!) love them!  They are played with regularly and have held up well.  The 4-6 fits my average size five year old and my petite eight year old. The 6-8 fits my average size ten year old. I would recommend these if you have a Wild Kratt fan in your home!"

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a fun, steamy read. I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine who is strong. I liked how the story was written. I read a lot of it and am looking forward to reading more from this author. This was a very good book. I enjoyed it and was looking forward to reading more about the family.

1,"I gave it 4 stars because the main character shouldn't have had any redeeming qualities, yet I found myself rooting for him.  The author deserves credit for that. Chemistry was great, character development was good.  There was a lot of sex and some graphic violence.  I skipped the violence, not my thing, but I knew it was there before I started reading, so that's on me."
1,"Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)
Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)

No PlaysForSure:
Rio (indestructible, so don't be afraid to buy a used one)
iPods (Shuffle has no visible display and is worthless, so avoid it)"
1,"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

I have not used there warranty service but it covers everything except theft and intentional damage for the lifetime of the product.

I bought 2 additional ones to the one I already had at the sale price."

Although I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I got to the end,and thought, ""Well, not a whole lot actually happened."" Sure there's a big ending that leaves everything hanging, but getting there made much of the book feel like set up for what has to be a nearing conclusion to the series. However, the series as a whole, I think, is one of the best out there right now for kids and adults alike."
1,"Great bed. Purchased 48x30 in gray for 3 month old German Shepherd to accommodate growth size. Very inexpensive compared to local pet stores. Puppy/ dog should not be left unattended. Tendency to chew( similar to soft plush dog toys). I allowed him time to become familiar with the bed before placing into crate. In my opinion, this helps me correct him to not bite on the bed. After a lot of practice runs and patience, it is now inside the crate & intact. He enjoys lounging on it and even observes patiently while I vacuum the bed. Any dry out liquids can be easily sponged off. I usually let his saliva dry, comb it out with his grooming brush to loosen, and vacuum. This gray bed does not shed. No bed sheddings on the tile floor or on my Gsd puppy."
1,"My son really wanted a fitness tracker so we did a lot of research before purchasing this one.  There are a number of things about this that make it a clear choice for us.  Firstly, there is no need to charge this.  It comes with batteries that last 6 months.  Second, it is waterproof.  It seems strange to have to remove a sites tracker before going in water.  Last, the price- it is pre ally no contest when compared to other fitness trackers.  In addition, this fitness tracker is a watch as well.
It keeps time perfectly and seems to be quite accurate with the steps and quite sturdy as well.  We have had no issues with it at all and it is on the arm of a tween who is not delicate and careful."

1,"This dres arrived dirty and extremely wrinkled, I know for a fact this item was returned by a previous owner or it was used on some kind of display. I received the dress the day before I needed it for my daughter so I could not return it in time to get another one. It had brown make up on parts of the dress, which I had to clean with make up remover and baby wipes.

The dress was extrely wrinkled due to the fact that the dress was STUFFED back into it's packaging. So I had to give it a good steaming job before it even stared to look decent. The same previous owner must have reinforced the flower appliques on the dress with a hot glue gun because there were dried glue strings hanging from the flowers.

The quality of the dress: it was ok considering that it is a child's play dress. Compared to other children at my daughter's school who also wore princess dresses, this one held up a day of playing, running, swinging, rolling of the ground/grass much better than the others.

My daughter did not complain of anything being itchy on the inside, which I was thankful for. I say that because the tulle fabric overlay on the outside is very stiff, as if it was treated/sprayed with a fabric stiffener or something.

The back of the dress has a little circle velcro closure piece that does not stick very well.

The dress does comes with the  crown that you see in the pictures...but it does not come with a wand though."

It was a breeze to put together.I bought this for my dog who is a chewer.  He will go to the vet and the vet will say that if he chews on something, he will get a vet check.  I have a 60 pound terrier mix and this is his first time chewer.  I love that he has a ""hairball"" and he has a lot of hairball hairballs.  I put this on his mouth and he chews on it and it makes him look like he is crazy.  It's also a good quality shampoo.  I would highly recommend this product.My cat loves this.  She is a small cat, so I don't have to worry about her getting sick, but she loves this.  She is about 20 lbs. and about 18 pounds.  She has no trouble with stomach issues, so it makes her feel good.  It is easy to put on and off.  I don't have to worry about her getting sick because of it, but it is a great product.

1,"They are good quality and I think the price was a good deal. I also like the new hex key adjustment built into the thumbscrew. A couple of things worried me a little. The 10"" strait jaw and long nose pliers have a bit of play, side-to-side, in the jaw and they don't necessarily align perfectly when you close them; there is no play at all when they are closed. I'm not sure this really even matters, but it bothers me. On the other hand, I'm not sure I've ever seen long nose locking pliers, old or new, that didn't have a little wobble in the open jaw.
All of the curved jaw pliers are fine, so I'm giving them  a four over the two loose jaws."

It wasn't a bad price and selection if you want to get an bunch to start off with, just don't expect the big lush plants like you see in the pictures.

Shortly after beginning the book, I knew she wasn't going to may the guy she was dating, but I thought she would marry another character in the book. That didn't happen, although I suspect she will in another book. One thing I really didn't like was at the end it announced that the guy she dated for most of the book was engaged, but it didn't day to whom (although I'm pretty sure whom).

We ordered 7 of these dresses for a wedding and every single one was different than the other. One was a totally different color. One had white lace instead of the colored lace. Some had ribbon around the arms and hem and some did not. One dress was really long while another too short. I guess the point is, this dress is a gamble if you buy."

1,"My husband and daughter put this Titanfall building set together and it turned out impressive looking. Our Atlas Titan man is able to stand (fairly large dude) and we are able to do simple poses with him. This model really does look cool when it's all together. Kids age 8 or 9 should be able to put this together, especially if they have had some experience with K'NEX building kits and/or have some help with assembling them. We've had other kits in the past and have enjoyed working on them together. Older kids shouldn't have a problem with the Atlas building set.

The downside of this set is that with some of the parts, they were difficult for my daughter to snap together and she is usually pretty good at that and has snapped together parts that I was unable to fit together in the past with other model sets. This was a little frustrating for her. The model does have some cool features like the little man inside and the usable weapon that I was shot with a number of times, but isn't strong enough to put out an eye.

All in all, this a cool kit that does require patience and a little strength-younger kids will greatly benefit from and really enjoy some help with assemblage. We have our Titan Man standing proudly on the kitchen table and have put him in a few different poses. The feet have to be planted evenly for him to stand and the surface he is on has to be totally even. This was a good rainy day family project and took a few hours to fully complete."
1,I was excited to give these virtual reality glasses a try. I have to admit that I have really enjoyed these virtual reality glasses since I received them. I have downloaded several apps just to get a feel for the glasses and have had a blast riding roller coasters and visiting spooky houses. The virtual reality glasses are made well and I think the quality is great! I love the remote control included and it helps with your volume levels without being able to access the phone. They fit me well and fit other people in the household well too with adjustable straps. It really is all about the phone you have and the apps that you download that makes this fun. Unfortunately there is not a whole lot out there right now but I imagine that this will pick up as the popularity of these virtual reality glasses grows. I really am looking forward to the virtual world as it expands. Really a lot of fun for the whole family. I did receive these glasses at a discounted price for my honest review and I am so glad I did! I think you will find them fun too! Give them a try! You won't be disappointed.

1,"The whole movie is promoting BUDWEISER beer. Is it a lie that Budweiser is the only beer available?

The human nature attracts to beautiful woman and strong handsome man. That is the truth. In the wild male bird gets attention from the mate, becuase their feather is shining and their voice is loud. Why Jennifer Garner should marry a fat and no-that-good-looking guy instead of Robe Lowe?

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?

I do not have religion. But I have no way of proofing there is no God. In the movie it mentions about mansions afterlife. How about 60"" 3D hi-definition TV for everybody, etc.? It's not what religion about."

1,"I can only give this item two stars.  That is because I like the print and the material, and the overall design of the dress.
I am a U.S. size 8/9.  I have recently lost weight, so Ihave trouble sizing online items sometimes. I first ordered a U.K. size 14 in this dress, then a U.K. size 12.  I don't know if they do things much different in the UK but it seems I must be a non-existent size which is in between the two previously mentioned sizes.
The size 12 is extremely tight.  It fits well in the hip and midsection area but is ridiculously tight in the chest area....to the degree that it smashed my breasts into pretty much two flat pancakes that looked really unusual from a side profile.  Boobs are supposed to be round.  I needed help getting in and out of the dress, since there is no zipper, I struggled pulling it over my head.  The size 14 was way too large...the dress fit baggy and awkward everywhere.  There was more than enough room in the chest area (surprisingly) but that meant that the bottom half of the dress was huge around my hips.  It wasn't flattering at all because the dress didn't have any need to cling or stretch to anything, it just hangs there.

I don't care to return these dresses because the shipping rate will probably cost more than the dress itself, so i'll probably sell them.  Long story short, this is a beautifully designed dress but PLEASE be careful if you are a busty woman because it may not flatter you but FLATTEN you.  Also, the fit of this dress may make you consider if this is a dress for a night out, or if it's work-appropriate.
This would work well for a woman with a small chest but ample hips.

For reference, I am 5'3, 140lbs, 36D-29-39.  Hope this helps someone."

1,"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No."
1,"One of those films you wish you'd written yourself.

I just thought this was an excellent film. As a low budget indie you couldn't ask for anything more. If there was a few million behind it, and some stars in the main roles, this film could be a blockbuster.

Why? Because it's credible. A few years from now, something like this WILL be happening, as AI influences people, AI becomes as real as real people, and it has the chance to become all powerful.

Forget movies like Transcendence. This is the way it'll happen, pretty much."

1,"I have learned that the ""GU10"" bulbs, whether they be halogen or LED, are usually much less in price than those regular screw-in (""old fashioned"") bulbs. This little gizmo will convert a GU10 bulb to fit one of those regular fixture sockets. And it does it well! The GU10 bulb has two connector prongs (it's called ""bayonet base"") to connect to the power source, these posts being quite similar to the connectors of old fluorescent ""starters"" in days of yore. But, alas, you may very well be a bit too young to remember those.

I do not know why bulbs with this type of bayonet connector are priced less than the screw-in type, but with using these adapters, your purchases of the GU10 bulbs will be less (usually) than buying bulbs with the regular type base. You'll add about an inch overall to the height (or would that be length) of what the GU10 bulb would be if it were affixed into a bayonet base style socket. But for the most part GU10 bulbs are much shorter than their regular base counterparts - so not a prob.

I'm thinking that you'll recoup your $$$ using these for the very first time (not to mention how much you'll save on electricity if you switch to LED bulbs)."
1,"Update August 8, 2012:

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

Original Post:

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard."

Plus included in the box are the lyrics to the songs just in case, as an adult, you don't know them! You'll be singing ""If You're Happy and You Know it"" with embarrassing frequency as it tends to stay in your head just like when the song came out!

The kids are able to record their own songs as well as sing to the five included prerecorded ones. The mirror is fun for the baby to laugh and giggle at himself as he watches the girls dance around the room singing in the microphone.

A plus for parents or adults is that the toy is easy to put together! The four legs snap into the base and are held there with a screw. No complicated diagrams or instructions.

If your child loves music, this is a great durable toy that can provide hours of fun and will hold up under toddler play!"
1,I should have read the description because this was way smaller than I had pictured it in my mind... which is not anything wrong with the product! It's actually really cute and a better size for baby hands than a bigger one would have been.

1,"I read about a chapter of this book. The writing is irritating, being 99% heroine's inner dialogue, with tiny phrases of conversation every page or so. The action freezes solid while we examine the heroine's inner thoughts, her past, her toenail polish ...

Forcing myself onward, I discovered this chick is truly too stupid to be out on her own. She let her former boyfriend walk all over her, steal her blind and humiliate her on national tv. This doesn't fit what I've heard of successful ballerinas, who have to be intelligent and tough as steel to make it to the top of their profession. It also does not give me a heroine I can relate to. Now she's chasing after a cage fighter ... and is so TSTL she leaves her expensive coat with cell phone and wallet in a cheap dive bar while she pirouettes off to chase the hero.

I suggest the hero run the other way as fast as his muscular legs can carry him."
1,This is really cool. Got it for my wife for our front yard. We put it up against our water fall. It is not real bright but enough that you can see it.
0,"This might be useful with some containers, as long as you keep your hands on the handle and the bottom is not too close to the bottom.  The plastic lid on the top is nice, and it fits nicely in the container.  I wish it was a bit thicker, but it works well.  I love the color, and the fact that it is a solid glass.  I just wish there was a bit more depth to it, because it is so very thin.  I have had it for a few months now,"
1,"I like how this book picks up right where the first book left off. I enjoyed it more than the first book and was very surprised on how Jenny Lynne made it work. I really didn't know how it was going to work out. As usual, the characters are their awesome selves. The book was filled with betrayal, action, and drama worth reading. I was satisfied with the ending of the pretend story told in the hospital room and the actual story. It made me hopeful for a better future to make the sacrifice worth it. The book held my attention the whole way through. I'm not really sure what else to say. I really thought it was well put together."

1,"I like these underwear. They came in a variety of colors. I like the fabric, it is smooth and it stays in place. The only thing that I don't like is that the lining that goes in the private part is white; I just wished the lining was of the same color of the rest of the bikini."
1,"As a former sporting goods purchasing agent for Kmart about 15-16 years ago - when the first mass production of metal scooters were being imported from China - I can say that I've seen a few scooters in my lifetime. Some of those sample scooters lasted me until today - scooters my kids can still enjoy these days. This is a scooter with a great concept for power - it's all manual yet very simple to operate. The one big issue I have with this item that otherwise claims to hold riders up to 90 kg =200lbs(surprisingly, this is the same weight limit as the jr. model, which is aimed at 4-8 year olds) is the following: the plastic enclosure at the bottom of the scooter, the part that holds a wire and is close to the ground seems extremely fragile. I venture to say if a kid rides on the sidewalk and then decides to go jump on the street, that plastic piece could easily get smashed in the sidewalk corner, and render the entire scooter useless."

1,"** spoiler alert ** I liked the first Jack Reacher book but Die Trying was a mess. ***Warning Spoilers***. Very little worked for me in this book. A kidnapped FBI agent keeps escaping from an escape proof room and they keep just putting her back in it. What?!? Reacher keeps escaping, keeps getting caught and the bad guys still don't kill him. Ok, that's a thriller trope, I can live with that, but it's pretty extreme in here.. None of the FBI agents behave like you would expect an FBI agent to. We can't send in the military, 8 Marines aren't enough against a 100 militia wackos so lets sneak in 3 FBI agents wearing suits. Really? Child leaves open loops about mass suicide and women wanting to escape the compound. Finally, it's a .50 caliber, not half inch. Militia members would know that so Child comes off sounding like a neophyte."

1,"Olivia Harcourt will do anything to protect her late stepsister's little girl, Jamie, but with danger licking at their heels, she's going to need help from a group of shifters called the Watchmen. Jamie is a special type of witches breed and her power is coveted by more dangerous, powerful beings who kill anyone who gets in their way. Tiger-shifter Aiden Shrader is one of the Watchmen assigned to them, and an instant attraction develops between Olivia and him. Forced to drive a long distance trip to safety, they can't help being around each other, nor stop the desire flaming.

Aiden was raised by a horrid man who sexually abused him. Finally able to get away, he doesn't consider himself worthy of any woman, especially a human one. Yet, he will go to any lengths to protect Olivia, even die for her if he has to. Hot on their heels are the bad demons and undeadlies. Can Aiden and his fellow Watchmen stop them from capturing or hurting Olivia and Jamie? Will Aiden be able to hide his tiger-shifter powers from being exposed to Olivia and thus, frightening her? Or does the thought of unleashing the cat underneath his skin make her purr?

A thrilling, sensual story that will have you on the edge of your seat with nonstop action, I enjoyed every minute of Touch of Seduction by Rhyannon Bryd. For readers of paranormal romance, it's a first-class adventure from beginning to the end. A major bonus point for the author providing a list of glossary of terms so as to not confuse the reader, especially since if, like me, this is your first foray into the Watchmen series. It made it easy to catch up to speed. A fascinating tale, be sure to consider picking up a copy of Touch of Seduction"
1,"This is a very detailed and factual book on the Battle of the Bulge.  It covers the closing days during the penetration of the line to the Nazis' last desperate charge in the Battle of the Bulge.  It defines individuals who fought in the thickest of the action, and how the divisions of the Army aided each other in taking the small towns of northern France and Belgium, building by building to bring the war to an end and rid the world of the Nazis."

They do run nearly 1/2 size smaller than the newer New Balance sizing, but if you've worn New Balance for years, get your old size and you'll be fine.  I recommend them.  If they  had better arch support, I'd give them 5 stars."
1,"It has a very solid structure, far different than many others netbooks that have a plastic body. Design is nice, it's a pretty and sexy machine. I wouldn't say fantastic because of its strange rear ""increment"". Anyway, better than the Acer Aspire. Keyboard is OK.

But, when it comes to performance... well, everytime you restart it or open Internet Explorer or Microsoft Office 2007, you'll remember that your old desktop machine performs better than this new little one and that you should have spent a few more bucks for a Dual-Core or a Core2Duo machine with more RAM."
1,"I must say I loved the book. At first it felt like Hunger Games but that quickly passed. And I like the fact it in based in Australia. But I did have to look up words as I am in the US and didn't understand them but I like learning something new.

I won't say a lot as I do not do spoilers. But imagine if governments wanted to breed certain traits into a new breed of humans. And not good traits and there you have the premise of the story. Works very well too.

You will have characters you love but so many you will hate. Just a nice mixing of people and places.

1,"The kabana does cover the litter box on all sides but I'm not impressed for the cost.  The instructions for assembly were not as clear as needed.  It is not sturdy.  Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust."

However, if you are newly married or married for over a decade the advice in this book has extreme value. I only wish I had found it sooner."

Set the timer for it to electrically cook rice then do the garden and lawn maintenance. How they managed to engineer this tiny thing to do it all is beyond me. If they had put half as much effort into writing the verbiage for this unit we would all be blown away.
Just plug it in, throw some rice and a splash of water, press the button and BOOM! the lawn and garden is perfectly maintained! Who would have thought this could all be done with a rice cooker?!

It also works with my Raspberry Pi (with a bluetooth adapter in a USB port). This keyboard with touchpad lets me work with it on my lap with the little computer plugged into the TV for a display. I like that the keyboard is full-size and metal backed for a sturdy feel. This keyboard is better than the Logitech K400 and way better than the Aerb ultra-thin keyboard/touchpad/remote control. I definitely recommend this keyboard with touchpad for little computers like the C.H.I.P. and Raspberry Pi."
1,"I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

1,"Comprehensive look at the immediate future for human employment as computers take over.  Uses his experience with computer chess programs to obtain some insights into human-computer combinations for the future.  For example, humans+computers beat humans alone easily and also beat computers alone.  Also, note that existence of computers smarter than humans (in chess) does not stop popularity of watching human vs human playing, or of matches of human+computer vs human+computer -- but no one wants to watch computer vs computer for very long (p. 156)!  My analogy:  we don't watch locomotives race either.  Also, p. 99, suggests that understanding how current chess programs work gives good clues to ways computers ""think,"" and how that is (will be) different from us.

Some Notes and Quotes:

(p. 8) ""If you and your skills are a complement to the computer, your prospects are likely to be cheery.""

(p. 8) Likely best future for us is commercial coalition Canada-US-Mexico.

(p. 46) Fig. shows civilian labor force available as fraction of total adults (?) went from 55%  1950-1970 to 65% from 1980-2010.  He seems to make a big deal of this, I don't see it.  Women went to work after  the baby boomers left home, so?

(p. 61) increasing number of American workers turning to self employment partly due to high unemployment.

 (p. 136) Re: worries about machines taking over production: ""If just about everyone has a stake in the machines, this could be a utopia.""  In other words, buy stock in companies going to full automation. Or, government tax on machines, as someone else suggested.

Has good discussion of what Turing originally meant by his ""test"" (not what you think).

Chap. 9.  Argues outsourcing and immigration are not cause of American unemployment; actually, we do better when we allow more immigration.

(p. 167) Surprising statistic:  imports from China only 2.7% of consumer spending!

1,"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's."

0,"It's no surprise that the film has been hailed as a classic, as it is a strong one.

But the film's most famous film is the fight between the two leads, played by Christopher Walken and Keanu Reeves, as they are trying to overcome the two men who are leaving a woman in a wheelchair to save her mother.

The film is so brutal that it is difficult to understand why it took Reeves so long to get the film off the air.  But it is a compelling one.

""The Hood"" is one of those films where the camera is shooting it's moments of terror.  The film is shot with great accuracy, and the actors are superb as they take to the screen to make the film feel real.  I've seen it many times before, and I never saw it as a horror film.  There are so many movies that feel like they have to make the viewer feel alive.

1,I was recommended to check out this book. I knew basically nothing about Norse mythology before reading this book. I enjoyed reading this book.  The author does a good job giving a general background and historical notes on the various gods. As a complete newbie to Norse mythology it was helpful and made for an enjoyable experience. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about Norse mythology.

0,"And now for something completely different. The movie is a two-minute miniseries, and the story is basically the same. The characters are different, and the plots are very interesting.

The movie is in English, which is one of the most important languages in the world. It is a great way to introduce yourself to the story, and it is a great way to get a sense of the characters and their motivations. The special effects are excellent, and the cinematography is superb.

The sound is excellent. I liked the song ""Yes, That's Me"" and the movie's theme. The movie does have a good story, but it is a shame it is not as good as the original. It is an excellent movie for the kids and adults alike.The movie has a good story, but it is not as good as the original.

1,"Review is based on only one use in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, at the Eben Ice Caves.

These cleats work very good on the ice.

Sizing is just right: I purchased a Large, for a size 10.5 men's winter hiking boot. Easy to put on, even outside in the cold. Fit great.

I also purchased a pair of ""Crampon Ice Traction Cleats by Rover Adventure Gear"", in a size Medium. They did NOT fit my boots, but they fit my niece's size 8 woman's winter boot just fine.

The Hillsound cleats are much better quality - the chain is stainless steel instead of basic steel that rusts, and the rubber is thicker and more elastic. But they also cost twice as much.

I did not give these 5 stars because I feel they are a bit over-priced, and they didn't come with a pouch, which the cheaper ones did."

0,I ran into this one a few years ago and decided I needed to make a purchase. I bought this movie because it's a must see for the whole family.

The story is a little slow at times but overall it is a good movie.

1,"This could potentially be an outstanding tool, but for a few unfortunate short-cuts and oversights.
Short-cut: detachable legs, designed no doubt to ship in a smaller box and possibly save manufacture expense.  My saw rocks back and forth across two opposite corners because my legs are not straight.  An accurately cast one-piece base would solve this.
Short-cut: cheesy plastic clamps that are awkward to use because the holes in the clamping tensioner through which the clamp rods pass do not align easily, and because in the angle-clamp mode the second part of the tensioner assembly that allows use at an angle does not attach to the main tensioner, but rather aligns loosely, requiring something of a juggling act to assemble the three items for angle-use.
Oversight: the clamp is not usable in its normal configuration (through the back, in the v-slot on the bed) for thinner narrow stock laid flat to miter cut because the clamping foot won't rotate far enough down.
Short-cut: mysteriously, the manufacturer takes the time to give a tutorial on geometry required to lay out angles for frames/boxes that are regular polygons, and even gives tips on saw usage, but provides crappy wordless diagrams for most of the assembly of the tool (which is not totally intuitive and takes a little keen observation to pull off.)  Annoying.

I want to note that the vendor I bought from (they sell through Amazon, so this is appropriate to mention), The Best Things, is a good company and I would not hesitate to give them my business.  But I cannot recommend the Nobex saw."

1,I originally saw most of this play on screen a few years ago on PBS. I was delighted to find that it was released on DVD. Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore are superb in this intimate drama of two elderly people in a nursing home who become acquainted with one another through playing gin together. It was originally a play and it is a play on film. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone who enjoys a good play on film.

1,"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable."

The leash is very noticeable- a reflective neon green (like what road workers wear) which is great when walking early morning/evening/night. My dog loves to lunge which creates more PSI on the leash, and this holds up to her exuberance."

It works great, and the size is perfect. I used it for the lighting in my family's room and it has a very low output (just a little over 10 watts). It does not have a flashing light on it, but it does have a very bright light. I would recommend this bulb to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan but still work great. I love the way the light is dimmed, but I like the fact that I can see them in the dark. I like the fact that they are 3/4 inch thick, which is nice. I would recommend them to anyone. My only complaint is that the handle is a little too large for my use. I bought a small set and it is a bit larger than expected. I think it's a design flaw. I have not used it yet, but it is working perfectly. This is the only one I have that will work with the Samsung SmartThings hub."

What a great story!  It has all the elements of a great adventure.  This book is a page-turner from the very beginning.  This is a great book for the history buff - or anyone who loves an adventure.  One of the things I like about Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe books is that they are great stand alone stories and you don't feel that you need to read the entire series in a particular order to enjoy them.  I have bought several copies of Sharpe's Eagle and given them as presents to those hard-to-buy-for men on my shopping lists."

1,"I wear a 8.5 US (41.5 UK) in Chuck Taylors and Merrills. The La Sportiva fits the same, but is tighter around the middle of the foot. This is as expected as this is my third pair of shoes from La Sportiva. The shoes are very comfortable, and what you'd expect from a hiking shoe. The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work. The soles, glue, and stitching are all in fine shape even after all that abuse."

1,"I loved this book! I wrote tons of notes for myself which I don't generally do but it is packed full of great information and ideas. Some of my favourites were: Be childlike! As a child you believe you can do anything. To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. (the author goes into this and it is really interesting!) Create a one sentence business destiny. (again-awesome) Success is not magic-its hard work! and Stop being busy. Start acting out of priority. I mean I could go on. There are examples of perseverance and hard work and free bonus materials that you can download. If you want to change the direction your life is going or if you want to be successful in what you already do then this book is a must read."

1,"Well, that's that... I gave Jordan three chances to get the series back to what it used to be, and it's just not happening.  I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.
I used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together.  Now I'm just bored by it.  He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_.  There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them.  The female characters are extremely under-developed.  They're all so similar...  But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.
The end of this book was fairly decent.  I can't say this book was better than the last two, however."

1,"I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space."

1,"I am very familiar with Carson, having owned a couple binoculars with HD glass. I used
those for surveillance work and for birding. One pair broke and they replaced them without
any questions. I very much appreciate the company. As for this monocular, I shopped around and looked at several and was about to pay a lot more
for a premium monocular when I decided that I didn't need it. I gambled on this unit, hoping
that I would not need the better glass of a more expensive one. It's a bit large, but I have
large hands. It isn't the easiest to focus with, but you become fairly adept at it quickly
enough. The quality seems good and I imagine that I will have this unit around for a long time. I teach firearms indoors and I needed a monocular to help my aging eyes see the. 22 caliber bullet
holes on black targets with dark backgrounds. I can readily see holes out to 20 yards with these
and I am very happy, especially at the pricepoint. I carry them in my jacket pocket for birding
when riding my motorcycle. Hech, I even tried the ant thing and it was impressive that I could
stand above an ant pile and watch them as if I was on my knees, like when I was a kid. I recommend this monocular and I promise you that you will like Carson as a brand, especially if
you have to contact them. I just wish that they would make a nice birding spotting scope. Regards and happy viewing."

I like that the toy is made from real wood so it is easy to assemble.  I love that it is made in the USA so it will last a long time.  The toy is not too big for my 14 lb pit mix but I like that it is made in the USA.  I can't imagine a toy that is made in the USA without some of the components made in the USA.

1,"As my former bugout bag (45L, no frame S&W tactical pack, which I truly love) hath recently runneth over, I was in the market for a larger, molle compatible pack with an internal frame. When I was offered this pack at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion, I jumped at it.

This is my third bag from Gonex, but the first one that doesn't fold up into its  own pocket. I was impressed with the heavy duty 900D nylon and the quality construction throughout. The shoulders, waist belt and back are nicely padded. The molle attachments on top, back and sides allow the bag to be configured in various ways by adding molle compatible pouches, and there are straps on top and bottom for carryig sleeping bags, tents etc.

My favorite features:
- included, attached rain cover (this is in the semi hidden very bottom pocket, zipper next to the lumbar padding). I also like that the rain cover on the desert camo pack is a solid tan. When deployed, the pack looks more 'weekend getaway' and less 'SHTF' with the solid cover.
- pockets in the waist belt. They aren't huge, but will fit small items like a wallet, phone or power bars.
- the zipper runs the full length of the main compartment, giving easy access to everything
- there are 5 pockets on the inside of the main compartment flap; 1 zippered, 2 velcro and 1 open mesh
- 3 position height adjustment
- water bottle/ snack pockets on the sides
- molle attachments everywhere!

My minor quibble:
- the lining and cover are a slightly different color (more yellow) than the tan in the camo. Not a huge deal, but I would have liked it to match.

Overall, this is an excellent pack that is worth the price."

The first book in the series follows the story of a woman and her dog, who are both in love with each other.  It takes place in a small town.  This is a very short story, but it is a very good one.  I can't wait to see what happens next.

This book is about a young woman who is on a mission with a group of people to help her to find her way back to her family.

1,"I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money."
0,"I have say I was a little disappointed with the quality of the product, but I am pretty confident that it will last a long time.  The ring itself is pretty sturdy, and the color is pretty striking.  The size is a little small for me, but it's not a problem.  I have a large chest, which is a little on the small side, but it fits my heart better than I would like.  The color scheme is a little more subdued, but it is still pretty good.  The sleeve is really nice, and it fits great.  The material is pretty nice, and the material is pretty soft.  The only thing I did not like is the color.  I really don't like the color, and I don't think it will be a big deal for me.  I really don't like the design of the company, and I think it is a little weird that I didn't get this.  I will probably buy a different color, but I don't really care about it.

1,"I have two cats - one who was OBSESSED with these treats and another who turned his nose up at these.  My cat who ate these was a consistent vomiter, and I always assumed it was hairball related.  However,  I started to notice that after she ate these treats, she seemed to throw up more.... I researched online and found 100s of people who reported that these treats made their cats ill to the point of death in some cases.  I immediately threw my treats away and alerted all the cat parents I knew of the potential risk.  I couldn't imagine losing my fur child to something so senseless!

After tossing these, my cat has had no vomiting incidents and has done just find without treats.  My cat who never liked these has never had any issues getting sick, which leads me to believe that these were negatively affecting the health of my cat.  We've kept their food the same otherwise, so this was the only variable that has changed.  If you must give these to your cat, please proceed with caution and keep an eye on their health."

1,"This is a lovely watch, and dressier than it looks in the photo due to the tiny (66) Swarovski crystals set in the bezel. The band, described as ""blush pink"" is ceramic (I'm not sure most people looking at it would know that) and definitely just slightly tinted--much more flattering to pale skin, I think, than a white band. The face, including the bezel, is about the size of a quarter--a nice size for either a small or large wrist--and is a slightly deeper pink. Very pretty..

One reason I love AK watches is because they have an extender and always fit. This one is slightly smaller than others I have which means that, for me, it fits better than usual when I take out the extender. For someone who finds it usually too loose with the extender out, this may be the perfect fit. Likewise, if it's usually a little snug with the extender in, this might be too tight. Overall, I think with the extender, they've got it right for most people.

Someone said the bracelets were tight. For comparison, here's this: I need to remove the extender to get the watch to fit and the bracelets (pretty accents in the three different shades--silver, gold and rose gold) have about 1"" of space left when they're on. They're oval, not circular, and I think they would fit most people who would be wearing the watch, with or without an extender.  The bracelets also each have a removable extender (hook with your fingernail and pull it open to remove it--no tools required). If I needed more room on the watch, honestly, I'd attach one of these extenders. Not a perfect match, but close enough that I don't think anyone would ever notice it. So, with three bracelets, that makes the sizing of this very versatile even for someone who normally would expect a watch like this to be much too small.

All in all, it's a very pretty watch and being so easily adjustable is also a real plus."

The plastic part is a bit difficult to get to, and it takes a bit of getting used to.  This is a problem that I would not have to deal with.  I also have had to use a cheap plastic back plate to get it to fit.  I am not sure if it will be long enough to get used to, but if I get used to the plastic back plate, I am not going to need it.  I will probably try a different one that does not have the plastic back plate.  I am not sure I will have the time to make any comments on this review.

I liked the fact that it was not just a short story but more than a short story. It was a love story. I'm glad I did. I'll be reading the next book in the series. This is the first book I've read by this author and it's a great read.This is a good story. It's well written and the characters are well developed. The story is very well written and the story is well thought out. This is a great series and I look forward to reading more from this author.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.

What a great main character for this story. I never give out spoilers or rehash the books description.  That said even though it's in the Heaven sent series, it's not related to any of the characters in book one.  This story stands on its own.

It feels sturdy enough, but we don't move it much, and we've made a point of leaning the lid against the wall after reading about problems with the hinges. My only complaint is that there isn't a good way to install a liner bag. The hinges prevent you from just hanging it over the edge.

1,"This is a really cute idea for those who travel with small to medium pets. I have a very small pet whom eats twice a day. This container held a little over two weeks worth of his food. If I did pick something I wasn't overly fond of it would be the size of the bottom and top bowls. I have a 5 pound dog so the bowls were a little to big for him to eat comfortably. I just brought along two small bowls for my dog to use so it really want an issue for me. You do have to take the handle off in order to open the container. I like that because it made me feel like it was added protection from spilling.

1,"Devon & Georgina (Gina) are a remarkable couple. She may have a slight tendency to be a doormat, but all women tend to (at least during some stage of their lives) put everyone else before themselves. Yet Gina typically does that only for those she loves, those who love her unconditionally. Devon is an exception. Hubris is the classic flaw that may yet deny him what he most needs--a woman who will love and accept him just as he is, poverty and all.

Their struggle to escape the hurts of the past and to work through their doubts and fears enables this book to be a remarkable romance that champions the power of love. Devon is the character who really changes in this novel, and his emotional battles are the usually the most compelling. But Gina holds her own and is the perfect mate for him. Their back and forth romance is fraught with both tension and delight, and is thoroughly satisfying.

Despite a couple of minor question marks (like not signing the marriage agreement before the wedding), this is a thoroughly enjoyable read."

The instructions were very vague and confusing.  The G1 is a 2.5"" toy and has a ""plastic"" head and a ball joint.  My kid had to use a different set to get it to work.  I had to have it flip over to work on the head.  I am very disappointed with this toy.  It is a great toy for a 5-year-old.  I would recommend it.This was a gift for my son.  He has been playing with it for a month and has had no problems.  It is sturdy, but very small for a gift.  I wish it had a larger size.  I would have given it a second chance.  It is very small for a small child and the size of the toy is just too small for him to play with.  I would give it 5 stars, but it is a gift and we would not be buying it again.

1,"I have just gotten hold of this one. It was the only one I hadn't been able to get and read. This series is brilliant. I wish he could write faster! I just can't put them down.

The main character Sherrif Longmire is wonderful. And the back up characters all add a lot to the stories - naturally Henry Standing Bear being a huge hit, as well as Vic.

This is well thought out, fast moving, interesting back story, well written - he has a lovely way with words and so funny. I have had some really laugh out loud moments with these books. Very dry clever humour. I love it!

I would highly recommend this series to anyone, even if you think a 'Western' theme is not for you. It's really intriguing and wonderful characters."

1,"This was a film that took a lot to get through. I stuck with it because I was told the ending was the best. No, it was not. I understand this was a play or a farce of films and Broadway, but it really had nothing to offer. Most of the action takes place in a restaurant or outside on the street. It is slow going, with nothing to offer. A nice cast, Jeffrey Tambor and Jesse Plemons, but it did not rise above mediocre. Not Recommended For Me."

I've been at locations where I've shot with both cameras, and the ELPH 110 takes much sharper, better pictures, so why carry the extra baggage? I've even started taking it with me to libraries instead of my hand-held scanner--it's smaller, the battery lasts longer, and I can instantly see my documents in high detail. The video capability is very impressive for such a small camera. The only flaw: when using the zoom feature while taking video, a humming noise is recorded on the video soundtrack."

1,"This was purchase for my girlfriends new 2011 13.3 macbook air. When it was designed I doubt there was any test fitting or any testers before mass producing this. For there are some issues with the bottom piece. When it is fully clipped on the top part hits the screen lid when you lift open then screen which can damage and make marks on the lid. My second issues is the little kick feet. I found them very useful but one is very loose and when carrying or moving the macbook air it makes a annoying clicking noise.

1,"As archeological and other scientific disciplines push the stories of the bible further and further into the realm of mythology and spiritual allegory (where it really belongs, rather than a literal account of events in ancient times), books like these are popular among those desperate to 'hold the line'. They serve as some kind of proof or affirmation that the biblical accounts were based in 'fact'. Frankly, this sensationalistic volume, claiming that a bunch of large rocks on a mountainside 'prove' that Noah's ark actually existed, is just the sort of evidence that a religious person would treat with skepticism and scorn as extremely frail, circumstantial and shabby if used to prove that a biblical event had *not* happened. About as much validity is attached to the author's work as that of Von Daniken."
1,"My German Shepherd is notoriously hard on toys, but I had high hopes for this bear since the Megalast balls are so durable. Unfortunately, this does not live up to the Megalast name. The squeaker called it quits after about five minutes (it was pushed back into the bear & rattling around), and almost the entire toy became bear confetti all over the living room within an hour. The only thing durable about this was the base of the bear--my dog still likes to play fetch with the rectangular piece that was once this poor gummi bear's legs."

1,"UPDATE 1/10/2016:
Despite the poor quality of these items and the doubled price, I decided to buy some more with plans to reinforce the hilt from the inside to withstand normal play.  The sabres have changed!  The buttons now have different and LESS DESIRABLE FUNCTIONALITY.  There is one switch that has an on/off position.  When in the off position, the other button does nothing.  With the on/off switch on, the other switch toggles between on and off- pretty useless!  The saber cycles through the colors and the sounds (which are, at least, still Star Wars sound effects), so that you can no longer select which color blade you want.  What self-respecting Jedi (or Sith, or Ren, for that matter) would carry a saber which has a random color with every swing?????

ORIGINAL REVIEW:

One of the sabres arrived broken out of the box with a tiny piece of the plastic at the butt end of the handle where the speaker is located broken off.  Otherwise, these were (WERE) super cool and fun out of the box.  It goes downhill from there.  Fast.

All three failed in some way after just hours of play, one failing literally within minutes.  On two of them, a flimsy plastic fin broke loose inside the battery compartment, allowing the batteries to migrate around inside the handle, rendering the lights and sounds inoperable.  I was able to repair these two somewhat easily by unscrewing the handle and gluing the fin back in place, but the fact remains that they broke after just a couple hours of moderate play.

On the third sabre, the sound stopped working, again after just hours of play.  I have not attempted to repair this one, and have not opened the handle to see if a solder would fix it since I don't have a solder gun anyway.

Spend a little more on something that might last at least a week.  No, I would not buy this again."

1,"My standards for movies are relatively simple - the plot has to engage me to the end without offending my intellect or my spiritual understanding of the world, the storyline should have redemptive value, and the action and script should be believable and appropriate to the situation portrayed. This movie sits on my shelf because it fits all these categories.
It's the story of a kidnapping, but it revolves around the person left behind - and here lies it's strength. Even though I am no great fan of Meg Ryan, her intensity and anguish were believable and moving. Russell Crowe is (as usual) excellent at defining a character in thin lines of nuance while David Norse was achingly fragile and volatile.
Its rare to find a film that doesn't deserve it's R rating. I think this is one of them. The language and violence in this film are wholly appropriate to the subject matter, and thankfully, all other offensive content was cut during the editing process.
A taut, emotional action film with a gratifying end."

1,"There are a ton of reviews on this product already, 275 of which are five stars so I'm sure I'm not going to say anything that hasn't already been said but the utility of this tool deserves praise. For $7 I can't imagine a better use of money for the usefulness you get out of it. For about the same price as a few Chalupa Supremes from TacoBell you can have the Gerber Shard. If you just use this as a bottle opener it easily pays for itself in terms of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew. On top of that its got a decent pry bar, your thumb fits nicely allowing for a fair amount of leverage. The screw drivers actually make for quick and easy option for small jobs when you just don't feel like breaking out the tool box. The tool itself its light and thin which makes carrying it no different than adding another key to your key ring.

The only problem I have with it is that it is a bit short for the length it is mounted on the wall. I have had to mount it by a little bit more than I was comfortable with before I installed the router. The shortness of the wire makes it difficult to find a spot where it is going to be too long, which is why I put it in a corner of the room where it is not going to be comfortable.

I would recommend this router to anyone looking for a wireless router to get them into the range where they can easily reach it and get a better experience.This cable works fine for the price.  I would buy it again.My only complaint is that the cable does not come with a cover.  I have not tried that yet.I love this case.

It has great characters and plot.  I felt like I was in the story.  It's very realistic.  I thought the ending was a little bit abrupt, but I'm not sure why.

1,"1. Like other complaints already posted, the US size was actually a 2nd step down...not just 1.
2. The inside fake-shirt is a bit of material sewn onto ONE side of the front collar, so it's obvious there is no 2nd, inside layer. So at the top, just the button-side got the extra material-flap to present the illusion of a 2nd shirt - BUT NOT the shirt's left side. SO stupid-looking!

Other than that, this ball works great and is great for travel."
1,"The world depicted by this book (and what I believe will be expounded on in the next two sequels) follows a few principles of communism - equality, submissiveness, trust, and longevity of life.  Thus, the main conflict is on the issue of ""freedom of choice"".  Being ""Matched"" infers that a pairing decision was made by someone else (an authority) and is similar to an arranged marriage.  The story focuses on how 3 teens cope with this reality as they ""come of age"".  The book is written from a first person perspective.  It is very well written and edited.  The pacing is slower than other dystopian contemporaries, but the flipside of this is a richer narrative of the main character's thoughts, logic, emotion and confusion (I wouldn't quite define it as angst).  Because life is often a battle between money and principle, love and infatuation, organization and creativity, and democracy and autocracy, I think this book is relevant to most people.  It all depends on whether you have the time to spend thinking about these thoughts and options."

1,"I've had this crock pot now for about 5 years and it still works just as good as the day I bought it. There is a timer which we've have used for up to 10hrs for simmering chilis. There are three heat settings for cooking: Low, High, and Warm. I really like how the lid snaps and secures to the crockpot itself. The lid and and insert casserole bowl are dish washer safe and I have put both on the bottom rack. I recommend washing in the dishwasher to help get those hard smells out of the lid and bowl like curries, chilis, meatball marinaras, and stews. My husband and I both work 12hr days so having a crockpot meal or two a week is a life saver. I definitely recommend this crockpot if you love a good hot ready to eat meal when you walk through the door at the end of hard day."
0,"Lee Child's Reacher books are a real pleasure to read. I will admit that I have been a little apprehensive about the book. The characters and plot seemed a bit predictable, and it was difficult to follow the plot in the first book.

I also felt like I was getting to know some of the characters. However, I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in the history of the American Revolution."

1,"I'm using it on the "" saw blade on my Delta 14"" floor standing band saw for ripping 1/2"" thick x 8' long oak strips. 1/2"" thick doesn't sound like much but it binds my 1/2"" blade in the middle of an 8-foot ripping - combination or underpowered motor and wrong drift angle on my part. Anyway, the stick works really well but doesn't last long as I had to constantly apply it even during the middle of ripping. Need to buy couple more sticks - use about 3"" of the stick after ripping about 600 feet of oak. An additional benefit seems like sawdust doesn't collect on the tires. Looks like the stick will save both tires and saw blade."

My son got ahold of the train and gnawed on it for a good 5 minutes before we noticed. The picture I attached shows a brand new pig and the train post-chew session. Even after his pit bull like gnawing, the train still looks pretty good, although you can see the indentations from his teeth.

The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass. You'll learn to love and appreciate the more realistic sound other headphones provide, and your wallet will appreciate it too."
1,"Received a copy of the title in exchange for an honest review.

This was a super quick, sweet little read that follows a jaded journalist and a male romance novelist. I was a bit shocked at the length of this book -- I wanted more and wasn't expecting it to be novella length! Sara Hantz writes extremely well -- the dialogue was easy to follow and it was easy to get lost in the feelings of Sheridan and Mac. The reader goes through the entire emotional wheel with Sheridan as she's told she's not getting the assignment she wants, and then through her falling process.

Like I said, I wish it had been longer, but this is a good taste at the writing of Sara Hantz"

2) the Hinterlands challenge- we haven't played this one yet. About animal outbreaks as well?

There are also quarantine chips. These are a cool addition and can be added at any time. They really help with the superbug challenge.

1,"I put in a 200-a Square D ""QO"" panelboard when it was time to upgrade, and figured why not put this surgebreaker in at the time, I had slots open and it seemed like a good idea since the house is in rural countryside and has flakey power.
A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers. The Siemens surge breakers combine the surge arrestor unit with a pair of breakers, which seems like a better idea to me especially if you have a crowded panel."

1,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."

They arrived fast, is of a decent quality however, the back of the shoe defies logic. the designer of this shoe should have worn them and then modified them accordingly. The shoe has a very hard ish plastic piece of material that for reasons known only to the designer of this shoe that jute's up past the rim of the sneaker to rub painfully into the back of your calf. this is why, i stated you can wear it for an hour or less but and a big but...if, you have a high tolerance to pain. this is the only area of this shoe that is vastly lacking in foresight and a flaw in its otherwise excellent design. i decided to modify my shoes myself and keep them because they are cute and of course, an earth shoe but seriously, designer!!! modify your design. i might not be so forgiving or tolerant of a poor design flaw where if extra thought were given, as in, the prototype had been worn by the designer, they would have very quickly realized the flaw and modified before mass production and because, this is not to be expected of an earth shoe brand, in other words, it shouldn't exist. i have purchased an arch insert to boost up the arch as I have a high arch and needed extra support, since its a lace up shoe, it has a very generous room for your toes. i ordered a 9 women size which, is a size larger than I normally wear so i would have more room for the fall and winter months when i wear boot socks."

0,"I was interested in this book because I thought it would be a nice introduction to the history of the Civil War.  The Civil War was a fascinating time and a sad day in American history.  I found the story of how the war ended to be very interesting.  The author also had a very good perspective on the history of the military.  It is a very interesting book.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in military history.I like this book. It's very easy to read and the characters are very well developed. I liked that the narrator was a little more realistic and more real.I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending.  It did not go as planned.  I was disappointed with the way the author chose to leave us with the ending.  It was a sad story, but I really hope that we get to see more of the characters.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get to know the characters well enough to really understand them.  They were all very well developed and were believable.  I liked the story line but I felt like it was very contrived.  The ending was a bit abrupt.  I don't think it was the best ending.  I also liked the way the book ended and the fact that it was written in the middle of the night.  I think the ending was a little contrived. "

1,"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.
I'm eargerly awating to watch season two on DVD now, and find out what happens to Buffy and her gang!"

My cat does not respond to typical toys with catnip or sound making toys, or lasers. I tried most everything but I noticed how he always seemed to use this or one other toy and the cats just loved them.

I play now more than ever with my kitty kitty and he loves this toy, makes him think he's killed a bird and his confidence is through the roof.

Thanks GoCat for a great product and Jackson Galaxy for a great show. What are you waiting for? Go buy this for your cat and let me know if this review was helpful!"
1,"Beware if you are a parent of a younger child.  Not sure exactly who this is geared for?  Maybe older kids and adults very into dark steampunk-style?
We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French movie that is dubbed in English and it is weird.  There are a lot of violent and bizarre scenes.  Very mild spoilers for examples: the midwife rips Jack's frozen heart out and replaces it with a cuckoo-clock?  Lots of bullying, including stabbing in the eye.  The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!  What?).  Again, steampunk fans who are teen and up may enjoy this.  As for us, while we appreciate the Tim Burton like darkness, the story was too bizarre and too violent for us and the kids had us turn it off after the second over the top song, really wish we hadn't purchased thisif you are not sure, may want to rent."

1,"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)"
0,"The Nokia SU-8W Bluetooth keyboard (Cordless) is a great deal for the price.  The keyboard is small enough to fit most portable keyboards and the touchpad is great.  The only drawback is that the keys are slightly larger than standard keyboards.  The keys are also not as long as standard keys but I think it will be a problem for some people.  I also like the tactile feedback on the keys.  The ergonomics of the keyboard are very good.  The keys are also very easy to press.  I love that the keys are not just a big rectangle but are spaced apart.  The keyboard is a little too big for my hands.  The keys are also slightly larger than standard keys.  It is a nice touch to have.  The buttons are a little too small for my hands but the feel of the keyboard is very good.

I really like the keyboard.  It is very well made.  The keys are a bit small and small enough that the button placement is not very precise.  The keyboard is well made.  I have not used it yet but I will be sure to update my review.  I would recommend it to anyone.

1,"For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion."

1,"I guess the biggest criticism I have of this toy, is really my own fault for not reading the description more thoroughly. I assumed this toy would be perfect for my daughter's bathtime, or to play with in the pool.

That's not the case. Everything sinks right to the bottom it you place it in water.

With that said, and admittedly that is more my error than the manufacturer's, the Party Yacht is a fun little playset. The Party Yacht is like two sets in one. The kids can play with the set like it's a big boat, and the yacht can also ""unfold"" to create a cool little resort, with slides, a grill, a hammock and a jet-ski complete with a harness for water skiing.

Assembly is a breeze, just snap a couple pieces onto the yacht, fold it up (or keep it open) and it's ready to go. While I still think it would've been a smart move to make this into a water toy, my daughter enjoys the set as is."

It is very comfortable, and I would return it and buy a smaller size, but I purchased as a lightning deal during Cyber Monday week, so it costs more now.  I completely did NOT follow the care instructions and washed in warm water, dried in the dryer in an attempt to shrink it and it did not shrink or fade!  AGH!  But - It is so comfy that I will cuff the sleeves and wear around the house, while keeping an eye out for these to go on sale sometime.

The first couple chapters were so slow that I didn't know what to expect.  After a while, I started to get tired of reading the same old story over and over and over.  The pacing was so slow that I was lost in the story.  There was a lot of tension and suspense.  I didn't care for the ending, and I didn't like the ending either.  I was left wanting more.

The second half of the book was so slow that I couldn't get into it.  I felt that the story was not worth reading.  It was just too long and boring.  I couldn't get into the story at all.  I was left wondering what was going to happen next.

I didn't like the book at all.  I wanted to know what was going to happen next.  It was like watching a movie that was not made into a movie.  I didn't like the way the characters were portrayed.  The dialogue was so immature and boring.  The writing was so lame that I just couldn't put it down."

We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner.

Shake some in, pull vial out and push catnip down in, and repeat. The beavers tail is a good ""grab and fling"" point that they like. The cats toss, roll, groom, rub and drool all over this beaver. They like carrying him around in their mouth too. I love that Mr. Beaver is refillable, and that you can clean him.

The Bombay's are a family of assassins and have been for the past 4000 yrs or so. If you are a blood relative, then you will become an assassin or die. If you marry into the family, male or female, you must change your last name to Bombay.  The children are all named after countries, states, cities, etc. The cousins that we read about are fun and funny.  Despite being assassins, they live normal lives, just like the rest of us, except for the rather large trust funds that each has.  The assassin business has paid well over the years.  They find themselves in precarious situations, and the fun begins. Despite the sometimes poor editing, I enjoy these books a lot. I tend to pick them up and read the next when I need a good laugh."

1,"These sorts novels rest a lot on believable characters. The problem with Florida novels is that real living characters in Florida often eclipse any fictional characters for stupidity, corruption and evil intent. This is the state that attracts serial killers, Koran burning ministers, scammers and con artists, and whose main reputation in other states for monumental zaniness. Here Randy Wayne White has created a sane grounded, and admirable character. Most importantly he doesn't make her a superwomen, kung fu warrior. She's brave and tough and smart, but she makes mistakes in a dangerous situation that are both human and suspenseful. The sort that anyone placed in a highly stressful situation would make. My complaint about a lot of writers in this genre is their characters are too masterful and unbelievable and you can lose interest in them easily. The second part that I liked about this is its a tightly plotted ""little"" story that deals with evil and takes us on a little journey through west florida and the thousand islands. And that too makes it very readable. The challenge for Randy White is that of a male trying to write in the first person about a female. I think it's extremely difficult to do. And I think the author does a good job of this. But not quite. Which is why I gave it 4 stars rather than five. It could be that as a fan I could not forget the male Doc of his other novels, and I had the odd sensation of the marine biologist sort of springing out in drag sometimes. I'm pretty much convinced though that this is more my fault than the authors. If you are a fan read this one. It's even better if you are new to his fiction. It's great, and a new start, for White. I think Hanna, as a fishing guide, and cracker descendent, will be able to go places that the good Doctor can't quite find."
1,"A waste of money, time and film. Not clever and not even funny. It's filled with over the top violence and vulgarities and this is coming from someone who doesn't mind violence and vulgarities if it adds to the story.
That's not what happened here however. If I had a dollar for every time a character used the f-word (an most characters did, multiple times in one sentence.) I could have made a decent wad of cash. The f-word happens in real life of course, I use it on occasion, but this was forced into the majority of dialogue just to be...to be what? Edgy? Hip? With it? If so, it didn't work.
  As for the story? A James Bond want-to-be with none of the charm or wit. That's this movie in a nutshell.

You will not often find a book in which the characters so confidently propel the story forward.
Ruth is dying of caner, it's plain and simple.  Though she toys with the idea of `curing' herself, it's pretty apparent that she will be leaving her friends before she should have to.  But like so many of Berg's books, this story is really about  Ann, Ruth's maternally-inclined friend, who temporarily sacrifices her husband and daughter to care for Ruth in her home.  While Ann is waiting on Ruth hand and foot (emotionally, physically and medically) there is plenty of time for flashbacks that take the reader through the women's friendship; through divorces and children and all the messy stuff that life is made of.  While Ruth's other friends also play intricate parts in the story, the focus really is on Ann and what she will choose to retain from her friendship with Ruth and this phase of her life.
Even though the subject is somewhat grim, I enjoyed reading this book.  One thing that is always consistent in Berg's writing is that she doesn't skip over the less-attractive parts of the human nature, so when you're reading you find yourself easily relating to one or more of her characters.  Reading is so often such a solitary thing, but when it becomes interactive it stays with you."

1,"If you have young WWE fans in your house (I kind of hope you don't, because that stuff is not well-suited to viewing for children!), they will probably enjoy playing with something like this. The recommended age for this toy is 6+, and I'd say that is probably about right. Many 6-year-olds will be able to assemble this toy, though some will struggle with it. Unless you want to assemble it yourself and keep repairing it yourself, you had better not give this to any kid younger than 6 years old.

This set CAN be assembled in many different configurations, and that will give it a bit more longevity in the life of its play. The biggest drawback to this toy is that it doesn't come with a single WWE action figure. It would take two to make it a ""complete"" toy, yet it doesn't even come with one. To me, that's just absurd. Every playset needs to come with one or more figures to populate it, and when I see manufacturers pumping out stuff like this that forces parents to purchase more stuff to even make it fun, it really grinds my gears. The action figures that are made for this playset run $20 each, so you can plan on spending an additional $40 on top of the cost of this set to even make it ""playable."" That makes it a $90 investment for a simple toy that will - in all likelihood - not be a great time consumer for your kids. Ridiculous! There are many better products for you to invest in that will produce longer play time and better stimulation of the imagination than this toy. Skip this one!

I just can't give a positive recommendation to something so incomplete."
1,"I just opened the package. They appear to be thick and of good quality. The only downside I can see is that the raised spots on the front are hollow on the back. Which means water, and misc stuff can get stuck in the holes. I'm hoping they won't be difficult to keep clean. I would've given them 5 stars if the raised areas were solid."
0,"Bought these about 2 years ago. The only problem is that they are too small for my dog. He's 8 lbs and I am a small dog, so I'm not sure if he'll be able to fit in the cage. If it's going to be a problem, I would recommend a size up for him.

I had to order a second cage so I could use it. It's about the same size as the one I was using at the time, but it's a bit bigger for him, so I will probably order a third.

I'm very happy with this purchase. I like that it's a good quality product. We bought a second cage for my dogs and now we're using the same cage for our own dogs. I've had no problems with the cage getting dirty, but I have no idea how"
1,Package arrived on time and the product came rolled up in a box. It has a strong lavender smell to it / chemical smell to it which I think will go away after 48 hours of waiting. I like the patterns that are engraved on the top of the foam it adds extras to it. The only reason why it's four stars is because it could have came with a foam protector. Guess I use the sheets to substitute for that.

The only downside is that it's very hard to get a signal out of the router. The wifi signal is pretty poor and it takes a while to get it working. This router is still very good for the money.I purchased this to replace the defective Sony A-100 on my Sony A-1000. I was very surprised to find that the Sony A-100 was actually a good value for the money. I had already purchased a Sony A-500 and the Sony A-1000 was just the perfect size for me. It is definitely a better value for the money. I bought the Sony A-100 because I wanted a better, more compact sound system than I had. I like the fact that it was 3/4 inch longer than the Sony A-100. I will be purchasing the Sony A-100 again soon.

Pros:
-Excellent sound system

-Great sound system

Cons:
-No way to switch between these devices

1,"My sons room is done in an alligator theme, and even though this is a dinosaur, it fits right in! I was so excited when I saw this, it's just so charming and fun for kids.

There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great."

The DVD packaging, however, advertises 5 cardio routines - as if you can choose from 5 different workouts, which isn't the case. It's actually 5 combinations (3-4 minutes each) that are then combined at the end to complete the 25-minute cardio portion. Overall it's not too challenging but the instructors are very pleasant and motivating."

It's cleverly written in rhyme, and my granddaughter now knows Room on the Broom by heart."

I always love a heroine that is strong and vulnerably honest at the same time. Shadow, the ultimate hot, broody, bad boy who is broken....I am however a bit of a Lincoln fan, will be interesting to see his character evolve more.

1,"Sam Harris, in this book, does a great job in criticizing religious faith. With his great insights in eastern and western philosophy and neuroscience, Sam does a superb job in conveying to the readers how to live life intellectually as well as morally fulfilled without actually believing in any supernatural God or falling prey to any superstitions or absurdities. The resources he cited at the end of this book are excellent stuff to read as well. Please read this book! Besides, I also highly recommend reading Letter to a Christian Nation by the same author."
1,"In my opinion the Galapagos Islands are the most beautiful and the most pivotal islands in the world that supports Darwin's Theory of Evolution and the Origin of Species. It's elegance and strangeness separate these islands more than anywhere in the world. You'll see lava fields, shores and beaches, sea lions, blue-footed boobies, and the albatross and much much more.

The documentary is in three parts, 'Born Of Fire', 'Islands That Changed The World' and 'Forces Of Change'. Two and a half hours of splendor. Wonderfully narrated by Tilda Swinton. The animals, wildlife and beauty of the landscape is captured wonderfully in Hi-Def.

I suggest this film to anyone who loves the nature of our world as well as the Theory Of Evolution."

Original plots and great casting.  Jack, I hate to say, was not a very good actor, but nice to look at.  The supporting cast were all excellent actors.

Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.

For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...

The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.

Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!

And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake..."

The option of precision/normal in phillips/flathead is nice, too. Again, though, keep in mind that this is a pocket screwdriver, so if you subject it to frequent use and abuse, it's going to act like what it is: a relatively inexpensive pocket tool."

Cons:

1,"I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house."

1,"Set in the 1960's, this `Happy Days' spin-off series that debuted on ABC in the Spring of 1982 that pertained to Joanie Cunningham(Erin Moran) and her boyfriend Chachi Arcola(Scott Baio), who move to Chicago and start a rock band, often performing at his family's Italian restaurant, but had tanked after only 2 months, due to weak ratings since it was ranked at #17 as 25 Biggest TV's Blunder list since people argued that Joanie & Chachi wasn't what viewers wanted to see since it was the ""Fonz""(Henry Winkler)who reeled in the viewers to HAPPY DAYS, which resulted in JOANIE LOVES CHACHI's cancellation in the Summer of 1982 with Baio and Moran returning to HAPPY DAYS in its final season.

This short-lived sitcom also takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it after HAPPY DAYS every Tuesday night on ABC when I was 9 years old in the 3rd grade and when we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had back in 1981-1982 when Ronald Reagan was President."

1,"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

Changed two sets of new batteries but still not working. Returned."
1,"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it."

0,"In another review, I rated this book 3.5 out of 5.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the most powerful man in the world, the great ruler of the world, is in the process of ascending to the throne. This man is still waiting for the sun to set. And with it, he will rise and be the one to rule the world.

This book is about the life of a strong man, the one that can conquer the world, and his father, the great king, who will be the one to rule the world.

The book starts off with a good introduction to the subject matter, but as the book progresses, you begin to get to know the main characters. I loved how the author used a lot of descriptive and narrative language to bring the story to life.

At the beginning of the book, the main character, Eileen, is a woman who has a husband and two children. She is a single mom and is in love with her husband. She is always doing something to help her children. Eileen does everything she can to help them, and it seems that she is constantly being selfish. When her husband dies, she finds a beautiful young man who is going to help her out. The story is very well written, and the characters are likable.

1,"The blanket is a perfect size for a crate blanket or dog bed. It's exactly what I wanted. I ordered 2 of the black ones. I would have given 5 stars BUT one of the blankets was packaged wet.  When I opened the plastic bag that was sealed and got the blanket out, the cardboard sleeve around the blanket was damp. The blanket was damp too. My first thought was OMG, it's used and it was pet urine!  I did a sniff test and I didn't smell anything foul.  I decided to keep the blankets since there was no defects other than the damp one. I am washing them really good to be on the safe side. I want to add, there was no sign of water damage to the Amazon box upon arrival. The other blanket was dry and the plastic bag the wet blanket was in was dry. ONLY the blanket inside the bag was wet. This is a good indication it was packaged wet and shipped to me."

1,"Benedict and Yeager describe a vast array of criminal patterns of dozens  of current and former NFL players -- including some hideous and barbaric  acts for which certain players suffered far too little (if any!) jail time.  Because of the variety and brutality of the crimes described, more than  the quality of the writing itself, the book is riveting reading; although  there is a strongly sensationalistic, tabloid-style undercurrent to the  whole piece which may repulse more careful readers.  I finished this book  with three outstanding impressions:
1) Far too little attention is given  to the successful redemption of specific players who have stopped their  criminal ways and become solid, admirable citizens (e.g.,  ""Hollywood"" Henderson or Cris Carter);
2) The writes make a  convincing argument that the pampering which star players recieve in late  childhood immunizes them (in their minds) from consequences for their  actions; and
3) The authors clearly intended to be shocking at least as  much for their own fame and fortune as for any noble social reform.  After  all, these criminal records are public, and were already well documented in  the popular sports media.

Serious football fans and sociologists alike  should read this book to learn of a surprisingly sinister element that is  liberally sprinkled among Sunday's heroes.  But while reading, cast a  healthy dose of skepticism at the intent of the writers."

Forever His Baby was a breath of fresh air.  It was such a fun read, but also had moments that left you light headed and squirming in your seat.  It fills you with love, longing and and a desire to rekindle that spark of early love.

I can't wait to read the next novel in this series.  I know it will surely impress."

I'm not a fan of the idea of the author being so powerful that she has to hide behind a cover.  I'm not a fan of the author getting away with it, but I'm glad I didn't have to buy it.

I have a portable sink, which can be attached to the sink, and the water is just filthy.

1,"For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy."

1,"Even a trusted Hollywood icon like Charlton Heston isn't safe from a certain amount of terror.  He plays the pilot at the controls of this 1972 suspense drama, one of the many disaster films (or ""multi-jeopardy"" films, as Heston liked to call them) made during the 1970s.  James Brolin is excellent as the seemingly all-American army man who orders Heston's plane to be flown into Russia.  John Guillermin's direction is pretty good, and there isn't all that much melodrama like we see in many other such movies.  The film was actually banned in Australia because the government there was afraid it would encourage copycat incidents.  Nothing of the sort happened, and the film became another huge hit for Heston in his post-epic days."

1,"Used the cart a few times already to move a Jackson Big Tuna yak, carting over 100 pounds of kayak and equipment.  I've had no issues with it after installing a separate tie strap in addition to the one that comes with the cart.  The extra strap is looped around the frame opposite side of the first strap which helps the weight of the kayak to remain on the entire frame and not shift to the front or back of the frame.  Without the extra strap the cart would fold-in if I hit a hole or bump when loaded.  But the light-weight of the cart and being able to easily remove the wheels from the frame make up for this little issue."
0,"I installed this thermostat in my house and it has worked flawlessly.

The only downside is that it's very dimmable, which is annoying, but not a problem.

The thermostat is in a large, multi-function unit with an LED display. The display is a 2-way switch, so it can be switched between one mode and another if needed. I just turned on the first mode and it is on again.

This thermostat is about 30 years old, so the display is a little too large for my small apartment.

You can't really use it for that, because it's only about 10 watts.

I'm going to have to buy a second unit for my home, and the dimmer works fine.

UPDATE:  I have a very small apartment with a lot of dimmers. I installed this thermostat in the garage, and it's been working flawlessly for the past two weeks.

1,"I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I admit, that I was a little confused at first. The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.

Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.

They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.

One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.

This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.

Maybe that's a good thing...."

Annemarie is at her younger sisters engagement party when she overhears her older aunts call her a ""failure at relationships, a person in stasis""

Determined that they might be right about their ideas of her not being able to progress forward, Annemarie decides she IS going to get married and she is going to do it SOON!

And so starts her ""rules of engagement.""

They are simple really...

He must be over 25
He must be Mormon
He must be intelligent

And with that list she asks her sister, Lisa, and her brother-in-law, Tanner, to help her find someone who fits the list.

When Tanner's brother, Ben, gets involved words start flying, and feelings get confused, and the rules of engagement list gets longer, and a truly wonderful story flows from the pages!

You will LOVE this one!

Do yourself a favor, though, and keep a little note in the case (when you put it away after use) reminding yourself to put the camera in ""underwater mode."" Last year I used the camera for my entire week of diving, and forgot to select underwter mode--many photos were washed out and blue. This only happened when not using the flash and when fairly deep. The shallow pictures were fine, as were the flash pictures."

Hades tries to see this as a second chance but they have to clear up some misunderstandings and keep her safe.

I have read two of the books in the series and enjoy seeing these good guys get their mates. This is the only bear shifter that has a bear shifter as his mate. It is a different dynamic. Hades really does love Cassie and they both have to accept they made mistakes in the past to establish a future.

1,"Update: Note that this is an episode 7 version. Revell released a new version (Last Jedi) in 2018. The new model comes only in black & orange paint version and has a pilot & booster (see the pics). The size of the BB-8 unit & sound effects are also slightly different.
---------------------
I've got 6 Star Wars Build & Play models for my 4 Y.O. boy so far. I think this one is one of the first models in the Build & Play series. While all the others I've got have both ""light"" and sound effects, this one (and the other X-Wing with black & orange camo) has sound effects only. The sound effect is also not as cool/laud as some others (TIE fighter sounds the best IMO). Nevertheless, you can't skip this one if your kid wants a Star Wars Build & Play model I guess. One good side of this is that this one has a little higher chance to survive in your kid's hands, compared to the Level 2 X-Wing from Revell. The Level-2 X-Wing lasted a week or so (My son is extremely cautious when handling his toys) before its super thin laser cannons shafts were bent and some parts fall off. I don't see any advantage of buying Level-2 X-Wing over this one. This Level-1 model looks as good as the level-2 X-Wing.

Compared to other Build & Play models, this and the other X-Wings are exactly the same except for the color. The difficulty is on the low side. If you want to introduce this series to your child before the recommended age (8+), this can be a good starting point. You may also want to try TIE Fighter or Millennium Falcon. I wouldn't start with AT-AT though."
1,"Having watched RAI's Montalbano television series (with Luca Zingaretti's outstanding performances as the eccentric inspector), I was expecting to find the novels familiar and boring. Not at all, not in the least. The TV series excel in giving us the visual feel of the exteriors: the superb cast of delightful characters; and the beauty of Camilleri's fictional town of ""Vigta"" in the fictional district of ""Montelusa"" (actually the Sicilian city of Ragusa, Italy, and surrounding towns). The novels give us what TV cannot, the interiors, the feelings and cogitations of the uniquely unpredictable Montalbano and the reactions of those around him. As Montalbano's faithful (and unusually astute) detective, Fazio, says to himself in ""The Snack Thief,"" his boss didn't become insane, he was insane from birth. The novels reinforce TV's visual charm and delicious performances with the ""insides"" of the plots, people, and places. In many ways, ""Voice of the Violin"" is the most noir of the series--plot and counter-plot turn the unraveling into a delicious concerto of criminality. One can hear the gears and the arpeggios whirling about in Salvo brain. Camilleri's novels are such a delight to read, I imagine Montalbano's police force colleagues, friends and lovers, even his opponents (criminal and bureaucratic), who lived the plots with him, would enjoy these books. And Montalbano? He'd read the novels and then ask Camilleri, half-serious, half-mocking, ""So, why are you always busting my balls?"""

1,"Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt."

We are impressed with the quality of the jacket and how it fits.  It is really stretchy fabric so it fits snug to the body.  Overall since it is black it has a slimming effect or look.  It has a wide collar that can be folded back or buttoned up around your neck.  The sleeve and body length is just right and overall the fits my wife's body style well.  I would recommend the jacket.

1,"I found this short history tedious.  I could not immerse myself in it and often found myself putting the book down out of boredom so that it took me much longer to read than many longer histories I've read in the past.

I believe the main problem is that the author condenses too many characters in the space without rounding the characters out; I do not find myself interested in them because they appear wooden...not enough insight into their personalities and not enough color given to their backgrounds.  I feel the author's past as a journalist has influenced her here.  She can write volumes of information, but it doesn't seem to engage the reader on a deeper lever than a newspaper story might.

I enjoy Christopher Hibbert and Alison Weir more.  They convey complex historical events with a gift for giving the reader a feeling for the time and they have an ability to communicate characters on more of a flesh-and-blood level.  Too bad.  I was looking forward to the book."

1,"I'm very pleased with the 4th addition update of The C++ Programming Language.

Dr. Stroustrup takes the approach of presenting the current version of the language (C++ 11) as a whole, rather than attempting to show what's new in C++ 11 compared to C++ 03.  At approximately 1300 pages of text, it takes commitment to make it through the entirety of the content, but you'll most likely be a better programmer if you do.

If you've attempted to read previous versions and didn't like Stroustrup's approach, then you probably won't like the new edition either.  On the other hand, if you appreciated the 3rd edition, you will probably like the 4th edition as well.

He presents the language in a rather terse style of writing with very short and fairly contrived examples, so it's probably not the best book for beginners.  On the other hand, if you are already an intermediate to advanced C++ programmer, he explains a lot of the finer points very clearly.  Some of the topics he addresses are difficult to find documented elsewhere. For example the precise type of literals -- 3, ""foo"", 4.0, 5.1f;  internal vs external linkage; unnamed namespaces; etc. Since he invented the language and is a very active member of the standards committee, you can trust that the information is accurate.

One of the other things I like about this book is the fact that Stroustrup is wiling to editorialize just a bit and describe things that he considers to be ugly, embarrassing, or bad style.  He manages to do this without ranting, which is really nice.  He also gives advice about constructs to avoid and techniques to embrace.

Happy reading and good luck!"

1,"These are good and work well.  I wanted to add a compressed air outlet in my garage soldering a lot of copper pipe joints.  I cut the 3/4"" copper line and pushed this fitting on.  Then I pushed the end of a 20.' piece of ""PEX"" 1/2"" - flexiable plastic pipe or tubing in the other end.  I ran the PEX down a center column in my garage and to a new air outlet.  Now I have a air outlet in the center of the garage.
Much faster than rigid copper pipe.  I avoided 20 solder joints on 10 copper fittings.  Most in the overhead working off a ladder.
PEX is usually used for water lines but it works well for air lines too."
1,"James Cameron has possibly given movies a new life where 2D movies just do not compare to a 3D visual sensory extravaganza. Going to a theater once again feels worthwhile. This movie is possibly the closest you could get to experiencing what life could possibly be on another planet. I was constantly amazed at the little details like a shrinking plant, a lizard with a parachute thing, bio-connection with other lifeforms and so many other little things within the movie.

The story was not too unique and from a sci-fi perspective, there are better stories out there (Enders Game for example). But what this movie has done is to create a benchmark for a new genre of 3D computer generated movies. The benchmark being both in detail and production quality.

This is possibly the first time I have seen a movie where despite a lukewarm story, I still was 100% focused on the movie and left the theater with the feeling of having experienced a new civilization. It took me some time to digest all that I saw within this movie and I may do another trek to the theater to look at the finer details in the forests once more.

There is a strong eco-friendly and anti-war message throughout the movie with the good and bad guys clearly defined. This one is a monumental work and definitely worth watching."

1,"Going Against Type by Sharon Black (click here for Author Wednesday guest post) went toward my type of delightful light-hearted contemporary romance set in Dublin, Ireland. The genre hearkens back to the 1950s with mismatched lovers such as Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, albeit with Irish eyes and tastes.

Charlotte ""Charlie"" Regan yearns to find her place in a world dominated by men as a sports' reporter and columnist. The hero of the story also fights for his place in the world of fashion writing where men are in short supply. It doesn't help matters that they work for harshly competitive newspapers and somehow find themselves pitted against one another when Charlie steps into the world of fashion by criticizing the footballers of Ireland for advertising popular name brands.

The novel reverberates with authenticity of the life of a journalist always under pressure to be fast, accurate, and edgy. Ms. Black, herself a journalist, paints a realistic picture of both Charlie and Derry despite their opposite views. I liked the twist in the story that turned stereotypes on end. It reminded me a bit of the movie with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, You've Got Mail. For most of the novel, neither Charlie nor Derry know the other one is the author behind the viperous attacks in the two rival columns written anonymously. In the meantime, they begin dating, enjoying their time together more each time.

If you want to escape for a few hours into the world of Irish football, fashion, and foibles, you won't be disappointed with Going Against Type. I think it's the first Irish novel I've read that wasn't historical, which makes it both refreshing and light."

All other ""goddesses"" are pale shadows. There was nothing as magical as Garbo. The script is corny at times, Lionel B. hams  his part(see Mickey Rooney ""do him"" in BABES IN ARMS 1939) but the film has a magic air that is spellbounding... In no way a great thriller or a suspenser(laughable when it is attempting 2)but a great GARBO vehicle. Roman Novarro is OK but is ruined with some of the lines he has to say."

Some of the tools are also designed to be used in a pinch, but it's a little difficult to grip your hand when you are holding it.  If you have a small hand, it's a bit harder to grip the tool when you are holding it.  I have my hands on all four tools, and none of them have held up well.  The tool I have is a very heavy tool, but I use it everyday for cutting, drilling, and other jobs.  I have a small hand, but it's too big for that.  I'll be taking it out and putting it back together.  It's a very heavy tool, but it's a very small tool, so it won't be as good as a full-sized one.  I'm not a big guy, so I don't know how many tools I have in my hands.

I have had many of these tools, and none of them have held up well.  The tools are more expensive than the ones I have, but they still work great.

1,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!"

1,"I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet."

I highly recommend this series for anyone who has not seen it before. It was an interesting movie, not for everyone, but I enjoyed it. The story is very well told and the action scenes are just right for a comedy movie. Good movie, great story line, good characters. This is a very good movie. I like this movie.

1,"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed."

1,"My children enjoyed this game when they were in the 2 to 4 year old range. There's a little memory practice going on combined with color matching.

To play the game a bunch of cardboard fish are placed color side down in the center of the play area. Each player is given a plastic boat with 4 slots in it. Players use a plastic fishing pole with a suction cup on the end to pick up fish from the center. If the fish matches their boat's color the player gets to put the fish in his or her boat. If it doesn't match the color then the fish goes back into the center. This is where the memory aspect comes in. The other players need to remember where a fish was placed back in the center if it happened to be of their color. It doesn't take much memory to remember one fish location until your turn comes around, but this is really for the very youngest game players. The first player to fill their boat wins. There is a variant that lets it use the numbers on the colored fish to play the classic go fish game of making sets and asking other players for matches. This variant stretches the age appropriateness up to maybe 4 years old. The Go Fish game lost its appeal for my children once the youngest was 4. They moved on to more advanced memory games like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Magic-Labyrinth-Board-Game/dp/B003RDJYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Magic Labyrinth Board Game</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hide-and-Eeek/dp/B003D7EPQM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hide and Eeek</a>&nbsp;after that.

The pieces are colorful and attractive. The game lasted fine through a couple of years of use. The suction cup worked okay for us. The game would probably work fine in a preschool classroom.

All in all it's a fun little game for the very youngest of gamers at a cheap price."

The negligence Naomi and her brother Owen experience can make it helpful for children or people who are/have been in similar situations connect.  Naomi lives a simple life with her great grandmother and younger brother. Suddenly her mother comes back in the picture. It seems she is there to actually reunite with her children after seven long years however her reasons for being there are malicious. Naomi goes through heartache after her mother comes back into her life. At first everything seems like things are falling into place with the return of her mother but then the longer her mother is around she doesn't feel the love and comfort one would expect from a mother. Skyla, Naomi's mother is an alcoholic and only interested in taking Naomi with her, leaving her brother Owen behind.  Just when Naomi feels sad and unwanted she learns her father actually wanted her and her brother when they were young before Skyla abandoned them.  After Skyla threatens to take Naomi by force with her, in desperation her great grandmother takes her great grandchildren to Mexcio in hopes to find Santiago, Naomi's father and get a letter granting his permission for them to stay with her. In Mexico Naomi is able to connect to a side of her heritage she was unfamiliar with yet always connected to by her carvings.

1,"About as witless and not-horrifying as you can get while making a supposed horror film. We meet four wealthy and one not-wealthy Southern college ""students"" who rent a house together for what seems like endless summer, although they're supposedly going to class. After interminable conversations about their pointless lives and activities, you start rooting for some slaughter just to end it all. Many, many buildups to climaxes that don't arrive, and repeated scenes of the ""students"" going into an empty basement with no payoff. And just to get a bottle of wine from a box in the farthest room along. I thought at first, ""OK, it's really a potion, and they'll all see the ghosts and attack each other"" but it was just wine. Then I kept saying, ""Since you're drinking so much, just bring the whole box up!!!"" But that would have been too easy. These are also the most subdued ""college students"" I've ever seen in a movie.
Of course it's fun to mock bad movies, but sheesh, this one messes up everything: A Civil War setup goes nowhere; scenes are brightly lit when it's supposed to be dark; the same mysterious sounds lead to nothing; a haunted student-rented house looks neater than something in Architectural Digest; and conversations mean nothing to the plot. After a few minutes, it's all about characters you wish you could murder yourself...I watched in sheer incredulity until it was over. (Yes, fine, I'm a glutton for punishment.) At one point, the camera even shook--a lot-- when a character got into a car, and not because there was a demon in it. The photography was actually quite good, if too clear and bright, so it seems more advanced than a student film, but comes across as more of a travelogue for Hampton Roads, Va than something calculated to chill your li'l ol' heart."
1,Purchased these to conceal wires for a wall mounted tv and it worked perfect! It even comes with a template you can trace right on your wall for fool proof instillation. Of course make sure you have a stud finder and drywall saw or other appropriate tools to get into the wall.

1,"For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!"

1,"Well, this was just a wonderful book. I've read a few of Kenny Wright's stories now, and really enjoy his light and bouncy style, and the fantastic suspense that just keeps you captivated - and unable to keep from turning to the next chapter time after time.

This is his first full-length novel, and it's a real treat. It is a self-contained sequel to a short-story entitled Rediscovering Danielle, and you don't have to read that at all to enjoy this one - although I'd recommend reading both, the short story nicely sets up the characters and their backstory and is a highly entertaining read in its own right.

Just Watch Me takes Dean and Danielle to exotic Hawaii, where the atmosphere lends itself well to  taking their little marital game of hubby-watching-wife-flirting-in-a-bar a little further, into the saucy realms of actually (gasp!) seeing her with other people. The story is well-paced and explores the whole risk-and-reward dilemma of a married couple very much in love challenging themselves sexually with the tickle of jealousy to fan their passions - it's naughty, it's spicy, it's so hot with scenes that will lodge firmly in the memory, but Kenny Wright plays it just perfectly in teasing out the nervous energy without piling on the pain, and leaving you with a satisfying HEA."

He is very pleased with the quality. I love these boots! I have them in a size 8, and they fit great. They are soft and comfortable. I have to wear them every day because I have arthritis in my feet.

1,"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!
  Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.
  Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.
  One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.
  Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.
  After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.
  The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!
Enjoy <3"

I saw a slip on, textured case at Toy'R'Us just after ordering this for $12, and I was so happy I purchased this after I received it.  Magnetic snaps to keep it shut, access to the dock port, headphone jack, antenna, and I think volume controls on the 2G (not really sure,) a pocket to keep a small microfiber cloth in, and did I mention beautiful genuine leather?

Since I run on a ""by the second"" schedule, it is important for me to know the correct time to the second.

I drive at night and the light is still working on the watch.  I had an atomic watch which kept perfect time but the light kept eating up the battery and was worthless driving at night.

The saw is well made and will cut your projects as you wish. The saw itself is not as sharp as a saw with a single adjustable blade, but it's not that sharp as a saw with two adjustable blades. I highly recommend this model. I have a few other saws that are very similar to this model, but I would prefer the two blades. Bottom line:  This saw is a great value.

If you're not aware of what a proper connector should look like, or if durability is not a concern, then this certainly looks like a great deal. It's half the price of a quality part. And I've returned mine, because I'm not willing to save money at the expense of significant quality reduction. Yes these look like the connector you want. But don't be fooled. They're the Playskool version of the real thing. Great for display or demonstrations, but I won't use them to pass 30A of 230V.

1,"genre: paranormal romance
setting: contemporary
format: collection of short stories

The author's book description is so far off as to be false advertising. This is NOT a novel. This is a collection of short stories. I only read the first. If the author doesn't take the time to describe the ""freebie"" stories, I conclude the quality is too low to be worth my time. The first story supports this.

""Bearly Mended"" shows potential. He & she meet when she (a doctor) treats his wounds. What I liked best is the universe, which shows potential. The leading man's personality & behavior was well crafted. The grammar was pretty good, which is above most self published stories.

Alas, the problems are numerous. The plot is fragmented. The doctor's behavior is so unprofessional (what employer would put up with an employee just leaving mid-shift without notice?) and unrealistic (how did this doctor get avoid working in an emergency room as part of her training?) that she would be fired immediately. The lack of police involvement cannot be justified in a society where shifters are known citizens. The transition between chapters can be rough, sometimes feeling like the author accidentally erased a few chapters.

I don't do ARC reviews."

0,This model appears worth the money. The only problem is that it comes with a small screwdriver. I had to replace the screwdriver with the TRS-80mm lens adapter. It was a pain in the butt to do it.

It's very easy to use and holds the TV securely. The only con I've noticed is that it has a small gap where it attaches to the wall. I haven't seen it in action yet. I would recommend it to anyone. I have been using this to replace an older Dell laptop with a Dell D700. It has a 3 inch screen and the laptop has a nice metal case. The screen is good for this kind of laptop.

1,"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!)

Two extra parts are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get:
(1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom."

1,"While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it."

Great for giving the illusion of freedom for that dog who just won't quit."

1,"This has been one of my personal favorites of the McGee series. Travis is hired by a very famous movie star who is being blackmailed due to some photos that show her, in the old-fashioned phrase, in compromising positions. (With more than one guy). The novel was written before you could send pictures on cell phones. McGee must track down the members of the wild party and find out which one is the blackmailer. It's a very good plot as McGee studiously eliminates suspects. And finds some have died and some, possibly, murdered.
  McGee's love interest in this novel is the movie star's secretary who accompanies him on his travels. The reason given for this doesn't really hold up but, hey, she's essential to the plot.
  It was another firstrate Travis McGee novel."

1,"This freebie is so worth it. Is short and cute and meaningful. Tork is a homeless young man. I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it makes me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now.

1,"It's been a while since we've had a movie where a child played the bad guy, or in this case, the bad girl. This movie really exceeded my expectations as I was expecting another predictable and corny horror flick. ""Orphan"" is billed as a horror movie, but in actuality it is a psychological thriller. Any way you slice it (no pun intended), this turned out to be a very good movie.

The first thing that comes to mind while watching this movie is ""The Good Son"" (1993), but ""Orphan"" has a better plot, more twists & turns, a more deranged child, and more surprises than you'd expect. Actually, Esther (the Orphan) is so evil and mentally disturbed that she makes ""The Good Son"" seem like a choir boy. Like other movies with this theme, the mother becomes suspicious early-on that something isn't quite right about the child, while the father plays the head-in-the-sand do-do who just doesn't get it until it's too late.

This flick is not about the supernatural or demons and such; it's just about one conniving, creepy, crazy a** kid who was adopted from an orphanage and who terrorized the hell out of a somewhat ordinary family struggling to overcome some tragic life events. This is one of those movies that you can't say too much about without giving away the entire plot, but I can say that ""Orphan"" is quite entertaining and is definitely worth seeing. It has great acting, a good plot, a great lead character, a little humor, numerous twists & turns, good suspense and a surprise ending. In fact, I'm anticipating a possible ""Orphan II""."

They are constructed from high-density polyethylene and have a powder coated steel frame. This allows the chairs to handle a sitting 400 pound person or a 300 pound person that is standing on it. I can tell right after unpacking them that they will be able to take a beating from heavy usage. They have contoured seats and backs. I noticed that they are so much more comfortable then the common all-metal folding chairs. I have sat in the Cosco chairs for over an hour with zero issues and I could have sat longer if I needed to.

1,"First off, I have to say I made a mistake buying this, not carefully checking the size; it's too small for me. Not so much so that I can't use it, so I'll keep it, but I would have passed on it had I realized how much smaller than my prior bag this is.

On the positive side, this is made of a sturdy canvas that I expect will hold up well. It has plenty of pockets: an external velcro-sealed pocket on either end (a bit small for my glasses case); a large internal compartment; and, within that, a zippered internal pocket. There are three pockets outside the main compartment under the flap, two sealable with velcro. These can be used for small items such as a cell-phone or calculator.

On the downside, the main compartment lacks any zipper or other fastener, so items can come tumbling out. The side pockets are a bit small, and one of the three pockets under the flap also lacks a closure.  Also, the strap is not long enough for my needs. I'm fairly tall and I like the bag to come down to my hip. This bag rides too high and feels a bit odd when I wear it. These are minor complaints, however, so I only deducted one star.

Overall, I would recommend this bag to anyone looking for a good sling bag for everyday, light use."

Frankenstein

Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier."

Kyle is a legitimate cowboy, a Texan, and a ""good ol' boy"". He's the sort of guy that you would really like to buy a beer and it shows through his writing. The autobiography is broken up into chapters with sub-chapters, making for quick easy reading and the tone of the narrative is so laid back that it's really more like having a conversation than reading. I love this book."
1,"I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller."

1,"This is a good dog-seat solution.

PROS: My 11 pound mini pinscher fits perfectly into it - it is big enough for her to lie down too. The seat can be hung high enough for her to look out the window, or set low (almost on the car seat) for extra stability. The fact that the upper straps are attached to the frame halfway along the side walls and not at the very front means that the full space of the box is available to the dog (i.e. the front wall doesn't cave in).  The clip attaches to the god collar or harness and is adjustable in length. The cover is removable and washable.

CONS: the frame is metal and the cover very thin, so there is no padding whatsoever if the dog falls against the side of the box or wants to rest her head on the rim. For some strange reason the short strap that clips onto the dog collar/harness is not looped in/permanently attached, i.e. if you try lengthen that strap to the maximum to give your dog more freedom of movement it simply comes out and you have to maneuver it back in. It also came with a HUGE (and I mean huge) clip for attaching to the dog collar/harness, so i had to replace it with a smaller one.

TIP: The floor does occasionally tip back, especially if the car seatback to which it is attached is tilted back slightly. The more upright you make the back of the car seat, the better the box hangs horizontally."

1,"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face."

1,"These are wonderful chew toys.  They do not splinter. Do not smell and the dog loves them.  However, they love them so much they chew and chew to get to the marrow and my daughter's dog ended up with 2 fractured top molars.  She was at my house and said Maggie wasn't chewing on the bone anymore and every once in a while she'd give a cry, like something hurt her.  I looked in her mouth and her teeth didn't look bad but one was definitely broken in the back.  She took her to the vet the next day and now they have a huge dental bill to pull the teeth.  So aside from the fractured teeth, pain and huge vet bill........I guess they are just fine."

0,"This popular book makes a point of the fact that in the history of the art world, the artists have always had the advantage of a solid foundation in the art world.

1,"I'm commenting here only about a belated experience to remark about the resiliency of this unit to water. In an attempt to move my jacket out of the way in boarding a kayak in fresh water (Rainbow River, Fl), one of the pockets of the gore-tex jacket accidentally hung out of the craft (unbeknowngs to me) when my partner sitting behind me said ""one of your pockets is in the water"". Yep, it had the Canon camera in it; it had been submerged inside the pocket for about a full minute (perhaps longer), but the pocket hadn't pooled with water, only was wet inside. Needless to say, it appeared to be a goner. The viewfinder had beads of water inside, and the screen inside showed condensation and water droplets. Also, the battery compartment had some water in it, but not pooled, but enough that I could pour out several drops from it. I removed the batteries, and over a period of about 60 hours, exposed the camera to sunlight on the dashboard and inside the glove compartment to dry out. It gradually dissapated the droplets inside the viewfinder, and the condensation from the inside screen disappeared. Only at that time did I attempt to turn it on. I couldn't believe it! The 4GB SD card was intact with the pics, and the motor successfully retracted the lens. A few trial pics confirmed that the camera is now back in working order. Call it luck, but patience prevailed in letting natural sunlight and warmth bring it back to life. I'm impressed with this experience."

1,"I have worshiped Invader Zim ever since the day it was born and I have two tapes of recorded episodes that I use to draw the characters and decorate my room. When I found out that it was coming out on DVD (Only like a month ago), I almost cried with joy. This is truly a wonderful TV show, animated or not, and it's finally getting the attention it deserves. Zim, the overly determined and somewhat crazy invader who just wants to prove himself worthy in a world where he is isolated, can be compared to many of us who are just trying to make our mark on the world. Gir, the lovable and fun-loving little robot, is like the child that lives within each of us. Dib's obsessive beliefs and theories relate to the things that we try to hold on to in the chaos we call reality. And Gaz is the anti-social, shadow-loving girl who we can relate to on really annoying days when people won't leave us alone."

1,"What I like most about this is the amount of water that it holds.  As a mom, I used to have to fill the kids water guns or risk my wood floors being drenched with water that they spill when filling.  This holds a lot of water!  I bought one for my son's friend, because whenever he came over, he'd beg to wear it or drench my floors with spilled water from his small canister that comes with his Nerf water gun.  My only word of caution is that since water is heavy, either don't let a real small kid wear it or only fill it up partially.  My kids were 7 and 9 when we first used this and they both promised it did not feel too heavy.  You can fill it up until you think it is a good weight for your child.  My kids also add ice cubes to make it a frozen blast.  I also like how it get's them outside for hours and they can cool off with the blasts."

And then, of course, music plays and lights go off ... great positive reinforcement!  The cookies sit into place on either side and the toy still recognizes them.

We have a huge driveway and this thing can't turn around. You have to either back it up and do a three point turn, or get off, pick it up and turn it manually. How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue. You need a grocery store parking lot to turn it around. They're now ""safe"" but no longer ""fun"". I will be looking for another version that actually turns."

1,"My fifth mora. There is no better Knife value than mora. Period. There may be some that are more survival oriented or that have a fancier steel Or sheath, but not better value. I got this one for camping food slicing and as a backup to my woodsy knife that literally cost more than 10x more. This has a 6 inch blade. I wanted stainless for food so I wouldn't have to put oil on it. The other reviews say the blade is 1/10 inch. Sounds right. It is a stiff blade with very little bend to it. Great grip with good palm swell and nice rubbery feel. Sheath is their usual plastic but more than adequate for any real life purpose.

 I thought about the model with the 8 inch blade but didn't really need one that long. And I don't see exactly what you would use that for that this one won't do better and that one would be cumbersome for some purposes.

1,"For lack of cliche's I'll say this one is a nailbiter. Imagine being confronted with your certain death, but then given a chance to prolong or relive seven hours of your life. Dan gets this opportunity to beat certain fate and make it up with his presence, and it's a race against time to get what he intended within those seven hours.
Our time on earth is limited. We all die at some point, and Mike Dellosso wakes you up to the fact of this limit of life. Once you grasp that, he paints a story that it's not what's behind you that counts, its about being intentional and forward thinking to the relationships that matter most in each precious moment we are granted here that matters. And once you realize this in the story, the pages turn very quickly as you hope against each obstacle Mike writes to see if Dan can get it done.
Despite your best guessing you won't predict the end, but it will leave you choked up and reconsidering your seven hours left. Even though you don't know when Thomas Constant sets your timer.

1,"The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.

The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scenes was a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This was not good vs evil, it was just two people who happened to be on two different sides of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII.

My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapters are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax.

1,"The Bottoms Up was difficult for us, probably because of the 65 pound weight of our dog. I imagine it would be much easier with a smaller dog. Holding that much weight with just one arm is tough, and we guessed that the straps weren't comfortable for the dog.  Having to put it on each time we took him out wasn't convenient either.
We switched to a harness that fits on the back somewhat like a girdle. We put it on in the morning and it stays on all day. All we have to do to go out is to snap handles on. And, since there's two handles we can share the load. I'm sure it's more comfortable for the dog since the weight is distributed over a large area, rather than the two straps on the Bottoms Up."

1,"The first Pilots Hockey novel featured Aleksandr, a Russian Hockey player who claimed to need a translater, and Auden, an American who knows Russian because she was raised by her grandfather.

This is a cute story, but part of it didn't really mesh well for me.  Aleksandr first off didn't really need someone to translate.  I can get past that part but there's a lot of talk about all the guys who want to be with Auden throughout and it gets a little ridiculous.  Also, the breakup, which inevitably happens in romance novels, was over dramatic and for a ridiculous reason.  But all in all it was a good story and I did want to read the next one when I finished it."
1,"Ill admit some of the changes in the special edition weren't great namely greedo firing first and the new songs in return of the jedi.  but this dvd only serves to make the films look a little better and have better continuity.  Greedo fires first looks a lot better and the timing is more like they fire at the same time.  Jabba and the speeder looks way bettter in a new hope this time.  the emperor and boba fett are played by who they should be played by in empire strikes back.  and anakin appears as he appeared before he ceased to exist.  how could anakin have grown older.  as obi wan says anakin ceased to exist when he became vader.  ill admit it would be nice to have the originals as a bonus feature like on the alien quadrilogy discs, or at least have a comparison feature so you can see the original scenes that were changed like on Star Trek the motion picture, but the fact is the dvd makes all good changes, so stop whining about it."

1,"This documentary is in my opinion a valuable expose of the credit card industry's ""back room"" techniques to get us consumers in debt and keep us there.  It shows the methods credit collection agencies use to get people to pay, and how those who are the least able to support a lot of debt in their lives are the most profitable people for credit card companies to get hooked into going into dept.  I learned a lot, and I think most anyone would benefit from seeing this documentary.

The two problems I had with this documentary were as follows:

First, it seems that all the average people (bankrupt or near-bankrupt consumers) interviewed in this film were portrayed as victims of the credit card industry, with no question as to how responsible or irresponsible these people might have been.  The bottom line is that credit card companies make people poor, keep them poor, and of course President Bush played right into their hands by championing the recently passed revisions to US bankruptcy laws.

The second problem I had was that although there is no narration, there are black slides with white text, and for some reason the editors picked a very hard to read font design and used it to create tiny paragraphs in the middle of a mostly black screen.  Not only that, the slides aren't up there very long, so be ready to hit the pause button on your remote so you can read the narration.

So, this documentary is worth a watch, if the price is right."

1,"I didn't go to this movie in theaters because I didn't know what to expect. I thought it was going to be some complete comedy with no seriousness or reality. I proved myself wrong. It approached some common, but challenging issues single mothers go through. It provides an accent on the stress single moms deal inside themselves, and projects how challenging parenting can be when you're single.

With a little more detail: Their children were approximately in middle school and disobeyed rules (technically legal laws). The mothers were forced to work together from the schools regulations. They conflicted with each other at first. Each mom's situation is very different from the others. But a connection slowly formed revealing the similarities in the individual challenges, providing support for each other, and trying to enjoy life.

Also, men were added in the picture/story, but they are not the main focus of how the women handle the stress their life. Men were included because it relates to what single moms may go through with their ex-husband, or establishing/developing relationship with another man. It also provides a good closure for creating a positive ending, since movies can't continue going on and on, like someone's life does. The issues between the mom and child(s) also relate to what parents often experience anyway.

I'm not providing my personal life, but I correlate to what the women and their children are individually experiencing, in more than one area/situation. Some people who haven't experienced relationships with similarities to the challenges (or seen another person's/friend's similar challenges) probably won't enjoy the movie as much as people who have."
0,"This is by far the best harness I've ever used for my puppy! He's been wearing it since we got him, and he loves it! The harness is sturdy, and it's comfortable to wear. It's a little thin on him, but he doesn't seem to mind it at all. He's a bit heavier, but he's still able to roll around and jump up and down. This harness has held up pretty well. It's easy to clean, and he doesn't have to worry about getting the harness tangled up in his chest. It's not a big deal, but it's a nice extra-large size for him. I have two dogs. They both love this toy and it's a huge hit."

1,"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Overall I'm happy with it.  I got it as a handy tablet to look up information quickly without going upstairs and starting my desktop computer.  Yes, it has it's limitations but I didn't spend $500 either."
1,"Faces is a party game played in rounds. In the first three rounds, six pictures are shown of men, women and animals, respectively. Some of the animals look better than the people, and I'm not kidding!! The people pics are B&W and are from the 19th century, judging from the fashion styles seen. In turn, each player chooses one of the pictures to respond to a question asked, like ""Which one looks the grumpiest?"" Others try to guess which picture that played picked. You get to advance on the game board if you do. Then in another round, two pictures are shown, and the person whose turn it is must guess which of the two pictures a certain player submitted. First one to reach the Finish space wins.

A fun game that will provide laughs. Some of the pictures are hysterical. This game is out of print, but if you're looking for a party game to add to your collection, consider this one."

No dead/bright/stuck pixels on the unit I received, which was a great start.  It's a very thin panel, not much weight to it at all, and the bezel is small and looks nice.  The included stand is garbage, like most at this price point - I'd recommend a VESA mount to give you more ability to adjust the height and angle.  Watching streaming video online worked well, and the screen kept up with fast motion in action movies, but brightness is an issue sometimes - best to keep this monitor in a darker room.  Overall, it's a good monitor for little money - just not great.

I would have liked a better clasp on the container -- it opens way too easily -- but I knew this was an issue before purchasing it, thanks to the other reviews.

Unless you are ready to ""finalize"" your project and willing to cut the cord, it doesn't allow for much prolonged creation time."
1,"So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

Overall, I've been a little frustrated about a couple of things, but generally pleased with this purchase."

I love the style of these slip on shoes. I bought the brown/ bronze color. The shoe was slightly short. Not uncomfortably so, but I like room for a sock liner. Not with this shoe. The worst thing about the shoe is that dip in the heel. Somehow that dip makes the sides of the shoe gape open. Noticeably too. I don't know how the shoe would do with a wide foot. My feet are medium width. There was no side support with these shoes.  They looked like I was wearing a shapeless bedroom slipper. I'm returning them. Three stars because they're lightweight, great material, beautiful color and I like the slip on style."

But I wanted to give the boys a little more variety, so I bought another set with crazy slides and spinning things.. it was terrible.  The marbles that it needed weren't ""standard size"", so you could only use what came with it, and the plastic was flimsy.  I tried another set, from an expensive European company.  That was horrible.  So I'm back to this one again, and we can connect them all together to form a huge marble run. We're having a lot of fun with this.  If you're looking for a good quality marble run, at a good price, this is the set I recommend."

1,"I bought this book with great expectation having read the glowing reviews here at amazon.  The premise of the story sounded intriguing---two 'ordinary' couples meet and form a friendship that lasts a lifetime.  Alas, real life is often dull and this book redefines dull.  The promise of youth and the sadness of aging no matter how gracefully, the love that endures sickness and health, the value of true friendship are all examined and with introspective honesty.  However, what isn't in the book, the great moments glossed over or ignored, left this reader wondering how Wallace Stegner got to be so renowned.
On a more positive note, if you can endure the first 3/4 of the book, the last 1/4 will be uplifting.  The reader will finally get some insight into Charity and Syd's dysfunctional marriage, Larry's unquestioning love for the invalid Sally, and the universality of Stegner's premise that one of us doesn't differ that much from another, each generation repeating its parents so that everything returns upon itself, repeating and renewing until the present can hardly be told from past.
Stegner writes a convincing enough narrative about the grace of surviving life, but as for me, the next time I want a story about nothing, I will tune in to a Seinfeld rerun."

1,"Toby, our 90-lb ""pup"", got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own.  The Petstep saved the day.  Easy to deploy, easy to fold and stow.  You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use.  By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds, and stow it in about 10 seconds.

From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.  The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I'm sure we'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own.  But she's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think."

1,"This review is for the charger purchased for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I am very very happy with this purchase, and cannot believe I didn't have this cable before! Like most people, I was using the charger that came with my phone which had frayed beyond belief in the 8 or 9 months that I have had it. Not sure why Samsung doesn't make more durable cables, but I guess they bank on the fact that you'll need to buy a new charger every year or so. But I digress. So my current charger was basically frayed in the section right where it connects to the phone part, so there was a 'particular' way you had to lay the phone for it to properly charge. This left many situations where the phone was plugged in all night, but it wasn't actually charging because the cable wasn't lying in the right position. Annoying, right?
So I was browsing Amazon in it's splendid glory late one night, as I've come to do recently, and decided to order this. Was pleasantly suprised! These are some durable cables! They don't seem flimsy, even at the USB and plug-in part. And the cable is loooooong. How was I tethered to the short, 1 ft charger all this time?
I really feel like I've been living under a rock, because this seems to solve all the problems of the original charger all at once!
 I like that there's a three-pack because, let's be real, my husbands charger is in no better state. And most importantly, because I'm sure this is an issue for many people, it doesn't seem to take longer to charge the phone. Now I haven't done an actual timing of it, but it seemed to take the same amount of time for me. And again, if the cable is in good shape and not finicky, there's less chance that it's just plugged in and not actually charging. I am very happy and will re-purchase these if they ever get destroyed. although whatever would destroy these would likely take the phone with it."
1,"Love this tool and have carried it daily for about 7 years. They have weak jaws if you twist--I've broken many of them, but they are intended to be lightweight so shame on me. Have also snapped some blades (but I've abused them). I also frequently catch the clip on my seat belt and bend it wide open. Leatherman has replaced at least 6 of these tools for me with refurbished ones. 4 stars because of the fragile jaws, otherwise I love it and use it multiple times daily."
1,"Like any film instructor, I'm always seeking an affordable text for my students. With the average text hovering around $80.00 (and then the additional charge for supplemental books), The Lean Forward Moment seemed like a steal. I say ""seemed"" because like many reviewers here, I'm a bit confused as to whom the target-audience is.

The simple, jargon-free language appeals to the lay-person (which is always welcome in texts geared toward the masses); however, the structure and more advanced concepts give the feel of an academic text. The Lean Forward Moment seems stuck in a perplexing gray-zone. While I feel Hollyn was attempting to please both audiences, he may have (accidentally) alienated both. Curious.

I know that it seems superficial, but one of the ways I evaluate the potential success of a film-text, is through its examples. I know (for a fact) that my students excitedly scan a text ... looking for stills from works they know/love. The Lean Forward moment uses many popular (and technically masterful) examples. The Matrix, Finding Nemo, 300, Lord of the Rings, The Godfather -- all good choices to get the cinema-neonate involved. On the flip side, Across the Universe, Brazil, Synecdoche, Contempt, Coons, Jack in the Box, Satacracy 88 -- these niche/obscure works are interesting to more advanced students (maybe). (And, now we're back to that gray-zone ...).

Here's my professional opinion, The Lean Forward Moment is fantastic for the intermediate student who knows the fundamentals, will be entertained by familiar examples, and is curious about lesser known works."
1,"Really cute in theory. But as others mentioned no instructions came with it and it didn't fit together well in any manner I tried. As time was running out I had no option but to use it but it was very wobbly/unbalanced in the only way I could get it together, and I had to rig a way to make it stand somewhat straight by tying plastic strips tightly around the bottom stem. I don't know why the manufacturer doesn't correct these flaws numerous people have informed them of since it is a really pretty design. Just makes you think they don't care, and if they don't why should anyone else?"

1,"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

Still, I don't regret this purchase at all!"

It's very cool to be able to adjust the light output of this bulb, but not too bright.  I will probably get another one for a friend or family member who uses it.

1,"I'm gonna give you the begginers outlook. I am only on day 3. I've done kick boxing and football so I'm not out of shape in the sense of not working out. I've had 3 knee surgeries and have fractured my ankle on my dominant (right) side. My dad is a pastor and a physical therapist healing hands I guess is why he toon that route. Anyway so I always got in homehelp but my body has gotten stiff over the years with cartledge and joint discomfort. We are talking complete subluxation (dislocation) of my knee caps from the sockets. So when I say I feel it in my quads, my hams, and my knees you better believe it. I don't know how well it's gonna play out but we will see. I'm 300 pounds 6'3 and I ain't obese theres a tone of muscle  on me due to I got into weight lifting. Yes I know it's not great on my knees to add weight but I'm trying to build my legs as well. So far Tai cheng has proven to be the hardest leg workout I've done thus far. I also enjoy it he talks to you not at you which is hard considering he's on TV not in person. My dad has seen the visa and if you're wondering if Dr. Cheng knows his stuff take in consideration NY dad a physical therapist for 20+ years said it's simple but effective since it's trying to make your body work naturally."

1,"In this case, the clich is true...I just couldn't put this book down.  This book was recommended to me, and I started reading it with no knowledge of what it was about.  From the very first chapters, it was apparent that the author had a gift for storytelling.  He was able to assemble the story, the facts, the characters and the energy in a way that leaves the reader begging for more.

Each chapter dramatically reveals new information, only to end with new questions arising.  As a result, I found it impossible to find a good spot to stop reading.  Five hours later, I finished the book, completely sated and thrilled that this book found its way into my hands."

So I promptly went home got on amazon and found them for almost half of what the department store was asking. And with Prime I could have it in two days and free shipping....sign me up!

My cat loves her dart & she's an even bigger sucker for string; her last string arm toy she completely destroyed - she's not very gentle with her ""prey"", so I was delighted to see this string almost completely incased in a plastic compartment. Unfortunately the string doesn't move sporadically in the manner that the dart varies in speed & quickly changes direction. This toy goes one speed, one direction. Pretty boring & predictable, my cat just times the string then grabs it & drags the entire toy around the house with her as it struggles & whirs."

I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid.

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands."

1,"An immediate return to Amazon, on their dime. Let the buyer beware. The holster provides more of a ""generic"" fit, intended for use with several pistol models. That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention. This holster doesn't come close to it in quality or functionality."

However, the biggest negative for me, and one of the reasons I don't use it much, is because it tangles up so easily.

The fight things are spectacular, the Japanise anime complements the movie very well, the music is great,even the dialogues are fun to watch, an unusual thing for action movies these days. You can even know that the actors are having a good time playing their roles.
Chapter Five called ""Showdown at House of Blue Leaves"" in which The Bride stalks O-Ren Ishii(Lucy Liu)with the 5,6,7,8's music playing in the background(fun music)and then gets in a sword fight with her gang in order to get to her is the best action sequence I have seen in years.

1,"I bought this mouse for use with my Surface 3. Since the Surface is pretty limited on USB slots, I thought it would be best to have a Bluetooth mouse so that I wouldn't have a dongle filling up my singular USB slot. I also wanted to have a small mouse that I could easily carry in my laptop bag. This mouse is great in terms of those two things. I was actually very happy with this mouse upon arrival. Connectivity was easy, the size was great, and the look of the mouse is nice too.

Now after 4 months of use I find that my left click is starting to stick. It's only happening about once or twice per day but I feel like it's a problem that's only going to get worse over time. I'm hoping I'm wrong but we shall see. If this started happening after even 1 year of daily use, I would feel like I had gotten my money's worth but to be happening after only 4 months is very disappointing."

Somehow, even though the sizing for 2X seems to indicate a C cup, (or above) the bra manages to both to fit and flatter my B-  sizing. And though the band in front does tend to wrinkle/fold over a little, I don't care. A bra that flatters and is comfortable is rare, and I am purchasing more."
0,"While I do most of my running, I'd say I'm not going to be using the extra weight from the floor. I am using the extra weight to keep the legs strong and straight. The extra weight is in the way of the legs. This is why I ordered the full size instead of the 8"" version. I had to order a second size so I could use it when I run with the legs bent over and on. I like that the legs are longer than the 8"" version. I have a small belly and I feel that the extra weight makes it a bit heavier. I would have liked to have been able to do that. I had some other reviews and they said the extra weight made it easier to hold my arms in the arm position. I have to say the extra weight is nice. I haven't had any problems with this on my bench."

I am eighty years old and have owned several clocks that I found impossible to operate,and this model is perfect for my needs.  If I need it I USE my cellphone as a backup----A great product-----"

1,"Bass is muddy but acceptable in a speaker set in this price range.  If you can recall to take extreme care when assembling, disassembling, or moving this speaker set, and if you're not looking for high fidelity, this is probably a perfectly fine purchase.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set."

But it has some issues.

First it seemed to use a lot of juice. I seemed to be putting batteries in it every so often. That was not that much of a pain.

But I discovered that once a station was program into the radio there was no way to blank it out. All you can do is program another station in that pre-set. In other words there was no way to clear all or any of the pre-sets. I tried and tried all to no avail.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two."

The end, while not completely surprising, was still good enough to make me feel like I had a read a good book when I was finished. In fact, I was sad enough leaving the character of Paul Brenner that I looked up to see if DeMille had written another book starring him. I'm currently reading the sequel to The General's Daughter, Up Country (a phenomenal story btw). The General's Daughter was an easy book to read, but also an easy book to fall into.

This is my sixth Tissot and has become my favorite. What stands out at first is it's stunning blue face. I can't help but stare at it just to take in all of its nuances. The bracelet has solid end links. It is a very comfortable to wear watch. Though it is a large case diameter, it ""wears"" very nicely. The bracelet is not clunky or heavy and is not cheap either. The chronograph pushers are screw in as is the crown. One thing that has impressed me thus far is its lume. It has a blueish lume that lasts throughout the night. The rotating bezel is solid and ratchets nicely. The sub second complication is also lumed which I find as a nice touch.
So far this chrono-diver has met my expectations and more. A must buy for any watch enthusiast."

The story line was educational.  I later did some research to better understand the Moari people.  That info would have been helpful before watching the film actually.  That added layer of obligation, and duty to his sense of origin would have made some parts of the movie easier to track.  While they did offer us some subtitles during more intimate tribal converstaions there were still words used that made no sense to a yankee like me.  The other thing I enjoy about foreign films is that they don't always tie everything up in a beautiful Tiffany box and bow.  This movie is no exception.  Life doesn't resolve itself in 2 hours.  The movie challenged it's viewers to think about life choices, desires, and the realtiies of following your heart."

It looks amazing in her room. It's also a good quality. I wish it had a little more space between the bed and the wall. We just have to put it together and not worry about it falling over. It is a good size for a single room. The drawers are also great for sleeping on. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
1,"I am a fan of Doreen Owens Malek, her dialogue is witty and she steadily builds the romantic tension between her leads. Her novel, A Marriage of Convenience, is an enjoyable read albeit this is an older novel and there is a sense of the characters being behind the times in many ways.

Sharon Phillips returns to her father's ranch in California after his death, she is not happy to be in the Golden state though because she must face her first love, Taylor Braddock. Sharon fell in love with Taylor when she was only eighteen when she visited her father for his wedding to Taylor's mother. Taylor broke her heart and she has not been in contact with him since.

Taylor is a Vietnam vet (yes, this is dated) and he has had major difficulties adjusting back into civilian life. He was a POW and he deals with his memories with alcohol and a bad temper. He is about ten years older than Sharon and he finds her sweet and innocent, way too innocent for the likes of him so he sends her on her way making her believe that she is way too young for his jaded tastes.

Ten years later the two are forced to confront their feelings because Sharon's dad has bequeathed the ranch to the both of them but they must marry to inherit. They decide to go through with a marriage with plans to annul it fairly quickly but Sharon realizes her feelings for Taylor have not gone away.

This novel deals with some big issues like post traumatic stress, loneliness and fear. Taylor is very complex and he is hurting. His transformation from an angry young man to a mature businessman is believable. Sharon is not as interesting as Taylor (how could she be, she's a run-of-the-mill lawyer in Philadelphia) but she is generous and it is her giving heart that makes such a difference in Taylor's life."

1,"The overall production quality of ""Lansky"" is barely adequate. This HBO TV special comes across as a film made under severe time and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the acting talent of Richard Dreyfuss is utterly fantastic. The now middle-aged star gives a performance that ranks among his very best. Dreyfuss clearly understands this low keyed Jewish gangster who lead much of American organized crime in the previous century. The character actor Max Perlich also does a splendid job of portraying Lansky during his earlier years. Perlich is a skillful thespian who deserves greater respect and attention. He ought to have received at least an Academy Award nomination for his splendid supporting work in ""Rush.""
Meyer Lansky was something of a highly intelligent mob boss who essentially perceived himself as a misunderstood polite business man; neither better nor worse than the titans of that era's capitalist business organizations. Lansky rationalizations conveniently ignored the fact that murder and other forms of violence are not everyday realities of conventional American capitalism. Lansky, though, was probably correct to conclude that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Estes Kefauver hounded him mostly out of less than noble reasons.
""Lansky"" accurately depicts the Jewish gangsters as far more intelligent than those generally found in other ethnic groups. Also, the Meyer Lanskys, ""Bugsy"" Siegels, and Alfred Rothsteins were the only generation of that ethnic tradition that chose careers in organized crime. Their progeny did not follow in their father's footsteps! Meyer Lansky, for instance, made sure that his own son attended West Point and became a U.S. military officer. ""Lansky"" earns four stars. I highly recommend this movie if you are someone genuinely interested in understanding the motivations of a Meyer Lansky. He may not be an American hero, but Lansky cannot be ignored if you truly desire to comprehend the difficulties of many to assimilate into our national culture."

Maybe this is my misinterpretation, however, I think most folks would think a Small would fit a 12 lb dog w/ a small head and neck.  Other than the fact that I think it is mislabeled, (and the fact that the jingling bells will drive anyone crazy after a few minutes), I would give this item 5 stars.  It is very festive, holiday-appropriate, well-made, elastic, and the dogs seemed to peacefully accept wearing it after only a minute or so."

I took her to a large social event today where hundreds of children and parents were present-- the harness seemed to keep her from jumping up (something that she frequently does)  and I really liked the fact that when I did correct her for not heeling at my side she responded well from the harness pressure and I didn't feel like it was hurting her.  The product seems well made, but again I've only used it once. I was torn between ordering a s/m verses a med. She is currently 30 pounds and has a petite build. I ended up purchasing the medium.  When tightened all the way it fits her well-- a tad big but she is still growing."

1,"I admit to being a dog show addict, but this series should capture mystery lovers who wouldn't know a St Bernard from a Pekingese. Harbert explains enough about the ins and outs of the dog world for the reader to understand the plot without burying it in jargon. And the plot has enough suspense to keep the reader glued to all its twists and turns.

Jennifer, the narrator of the first three books, alternates with Sabrina, the teen-age rising star of the dog show world. This is partly because of Sabrina's  closeness in age to the teens and sub-teens showing their dogs in Junior Showmanship competition and also because there is just too much happening for Jennifer to narrate it all believably. Characters, human and canine, from the previous books develop their personalities and the backgrounds continue to be so clearly described that you feel you could walk into them.

The denouement follows smoothly from what has gone before. I have only one criticism of the ending and that relates to the dog show suspense, not the mystery. There is a plot thread left dangling and I, at least, want to know what happened.

I look forward to the next book to satisfy my curiosity as well as provide a good read."

1,"In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am."
1,"I had set this aside because it wasn't clicking for meat the start, but I finally finished Light My Fire (Dragon Kin series Book 7). I had a hard time getting into this - until Gwenvale and Dagmar's spawn made the scene...but then again theirs was my favorite book. After that point the book was pretty good. The romance for Celwyn and 'she of the ridiculously long name' was thin, but I liked him. I am not overly thrilled with Anwyn anymore or the 'abominations', but the rest of the 'family' stuff was entertaining."
0,"As with everything, the rechargeable battery will last a long time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to install, so you have to drill down a little to get the batteries in. If you are going to use it for a lot of jobs, it will be a pain. I would recommend using the battery with a strong enough wire. I just put the wire in a little bit and it will be all right. I have no idea how to program it for a lot of jobs, but I'm not going to put it in a shop or garage.

Overall, I was very happy with this product. It is a very good product for the price. I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it at a good distance from your work area.

1,"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue."
0,"I love Andy Garcia but this movie is just too much of a boring, slow, slow movie.

I had to watch it again and again to understand the significance of it all.

The movie is in English so it was a little long and I wasn't able to understand the subtitles.

The acting was decent but the plot was just too simplistic.

There is a great scene with the young woman who is on a train with a group of people.

I really enjoyed it.

Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action movie and wants a good story with some good acting.I have watched this movie for years and I still have it to watch again. I loved it when it was on TV."

I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use. They are fine for the dishwasher, I always put in the top rack personally.

1,"Nine years ago, Alex Delaware successfully treated Melissa Dickinson, a tormented and phobic young girl, irrationally scared of almost everything. After two years of treatment, Melissa seems almost totally recovered, so her need for Dr Delaware ceases, and she becomes one of his most spectacular triumphs. Now, Melissa contacts Alex again, this time seeking advice concerning her mother. Gina Dickinson is a recluse, an ex-actress hiding away from the world ever since a vicious acid attack that left her scarred for life, even after extensive and traumatic plastic surgery. Even though Gina is now seeing, with some effect, a psychiatrist of her own, Melissa wants to know if Alex feels her mother could cope if she went away, accepting her place Harvard. Then, one day, Gina inexplicably climbs into her car, and drives off into thin air, leaving a tangled mystery to be unravelled in her wake.
I had started to think that this series was in danger of going stale. The prose is adequate and easy to read, but hardly full of spirit and at times seems a little perfunctory, and Alex Delaware has also remained a rather static - if very likeable - character. But now, after reading Kellerman's excellent standalone ""The Butcher's Theatre"", I returned to the series with ""Private Eyes"", and found it a wonderfully invigorating experience. This may be his lone of his longest Delaware books to date, but every word is fascinating, and there seems to me to be fresh fire in the writing. The characters are all very well developed, and although Kellerman never really takes any risks with his well-structured plot, it's a complex and clever book that really kicks the brain into gear, and presents one or two nice surprises along the way.
The psychology is dead-on, the relationships are all fascinating, the characterisation is acute, and the resolution is exciting, well-done, and satisfying. This may well turn out to be the rock of the Delaware series. To find out, i shall have to read on..."

1,"Hell Town, 1937 film

It starts with a cattle drive of Herefords (not the longhorn cattle of the mid-19th century). Men ride up shooting pistols to turn the herd. Horses are also driven. Three men make a stand by trees. The rustlers drive off the cattle. In town there is action at ""The Casino"". Tom gives $100 to his cousin and his friend, but this is refused. Bart Hammond owns the saloon and talks to his associates. He talks to two men and offers them a job as cooks. A rattlesnake causes a horse to run off until Miss Judy is rescued. Cattle will be driven to the railroad by Dave. Will the rustlers try again? Yes, when there are only two guards.

The cattle arrive in town to be loaded on the railroad for shipment. The cowboys want to celebrate in town. Will Dave play poker? The waiter switches a deck of cards! This lets the professional player win. [A lesson for the audience.] Tom explains his actions to Miss Judy. In town Tom sits in at the poker game and discovers the cold deck! There is a shot, Tom rides off with the money. The gamblers chase them. Will help come in time? Yes. Dave and his partner return to Montana.

Did you learn a lesson about gambling? This was adopted from a Zane Grey novel ""Born to the West"". Professional gamblers know all kind of tricks."

1,"a lot of the reviews say the consistency is too dry, i was a bit hesitant to buy it after reading that... but i went ahead and purchased this type because i was on a budget and its $10 cheaper than the venison and sweet potato pack. received it today and both of my dogs devoured it. i was feeding them chicken soup for the puppy lovers soul wet food mixed with 1/4 cup dry chicken soup dog food (was still using up the puppy cans, both dogs are on to adult food now) and that stuff smelled like canned dog food. nothing special. they ate it and it didn't make them sick... but i wanted something better and preferably grain free. ran out of the wet the other day before making this purchase and substituted with a scoop of pedigree puppy formula wet food and pretty much within 5 minutes after finishing eating my boy was throwing up. scrapped that can. this stuff smells ALMOST like human food, you can see the potato chunks in it, wich i didn't think were too overbearing, my dogs love potatoes so its not a problem anyways. so far, so good. its been about an hour and neither one has puked.

as for the dry consistency, its not really an issue for me since i just use the wet to entice them to eat their dry food. my boy dog will not eat plain dry kibbles, period. he really seemed to enjoy this stuff."

One side unzips all the way around and the other unzips enough for her to stick her head out. The bottom is sturdy and does not sag under her weight.
I purchased this for road trips when we stop to eat and the restaurants aren't always necessarily dog friendly. Seems like it will be perfect for that. We are currently training her to get in and she seems to be adjusting well."

1,"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!"

1,Bought this with great anticipation of this Hemingway biopic but it just seemed to go on and on ad nauseum..
1,"I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system."

1,"I've loved this movie since the first time I saw it in theater.  Its Andrew Dice Clay's first feature film and it delivers the typical Dice-persona antics.  Yes he had many misogynistic jokes at the time, but I separate this movie from his comedy; I mean, he takes care of a koala bear in the movie, how mean could he be?

The movie is about his character Ford Fairlane, a rockabilly style detective who works on cases for rock stars.  The only problem is most of his clients pay him in things other than money, such as guitars, sex, etc...

He comes across a case that involves finding 3 different cds or something like that.  I mean, they actually tried to put a plot in this movie, but you could have had a movie alone with just the main characters antics.  In a classic scene, Ford wakes up with two women in his bed and as the women start to leave he pleasingly begs them, ""hey girls, make breakfast, do my laundry""; classic stuff.

Eventually, Wayne Newton shows up as the bad guy and we are treated to scenes of Ford Fairlane making witty remarks towards Wayne Newton's character(Julien Grendel).

If you want to brush up on classic 90s films or just a decent comedy in general, check this one out.  His comedic style may or may not work for you, but I think if you start watching it and your entertained you'll be pleased with this one."

1,"but, then, I realized that it has no memory expandability, a small screen, and a non-replaceable battery. I wondered why. Then, I happened upon the Aiptek A-HD+ 1080P which had all those features and more. It weighs a tiny bit more, but gives much more bang for the buck. A little bit cheaper too. Not as sexy though. Anyway, I bought the Aiptek and that's that. It's well worth considering. Just a tip, IMHO.

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback. I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture. I continue to recommend looking at it as you shop. Variety is the spice of life you know."

1,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."

[or time!] And then supplement them with leah Sarago's ballet body downloads. [again just do a google, you'll find them and they work hand in hand with the dvds].

Regarding the dvds:
Leah will slay you dead - and the beautiful part is that just when you think your thighs can't take anymore, guess what: glute time! and then rinse and repeat. The sequencing is magical, and just enough work and holds for you it to make a difference. Leah Sarago knows what she's doing and the results are nothing you've never seen - because you actually DO see them

[please note: Leah does work the thighs a LOT - so if you are prone to ""bulking"" I strongly suggest you do a good 15 minute stretch everytime you use this dvd. It helps your muscles develop properly, especially your glutes, which you work a lot anyway].

Your heart rate will go up, your legs will look fantastic. There is are rotations available to get maximum results. Again, regardless of your age or size or time, this will do the trick. [and supplement with the downloads! 93+ and counting!].

I always say Leah is love and I LOVE these dvds. Buy them. Do them. Get Results.
I am, and Ive lost almost 100lbs."

1,"I enjoyed this book. I was glued to the book because I didn't know what was going to happen next. There is suspense through out the the  story.  Tara adjusted well to not having any memory of herself. I thought Marcus would have a chance to explain himself, but he didn't have to it all came out in the end.

The unrated edition is the original story and well worth watching.
They hacked up the unrated edition to make the PG-13 edition. I really don't see this as a kid's movie.
If you want a good movie get the unrated edition. I am going to max out the stars for the UNRATED edition."

Over all the story was good. True to form with the Madame Eve format.

Loved the interaction with his guy friend. Loved the elevator sexy scene."
1,"""The Winter's Tale"" is one of Shakespeare's last plays, and it boasts one of the best ensembles of characters in the entire canon. This is a text where no single character dominates, and many have more than one brilliant moment.
The play follows the jealously inspired downfall, and eventually redemption, of King Leontes. While taking us on that journey Shakespeare glorifies the ideas of grace and forgiveness, the simplicity of country life, the lasting bonds of friendship, the power of parenting, the ardor of young love, the patience of mature love, and in the great character of Paulina, the lengths and benefits of loyalty. This text is the result of a writer at the top of his game, and the episodic plot (it takes place over 16 years) allows the Bard to weave in many varying themes that lead to a pleasing and satisfying conclusion.
This text is often maligned as not one of Shakespeare's better efforts, and I wholeheartedly disagree. Read it, and then try to find a really superior theatre company doing a performance. Enter the kingdoms of Sicilia and Bohemia; meet Paulina, Autolycus, the Old Shepherd and his doltish son, as well as many others. You will be glad you did!
As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is usually top notch and the editions themselves look good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feel like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."
1,"My son is a huge Cars fan.  He has decided he wants the entire Radiator Spinrgs set.  Though I do not think the quality is that great, my son loves it and places with it daily.  As a parent I can see the flaws (the car doesn't jump the 8, there really isn't much to this piece of the set, etc), my son feels the exact opposite.  At the end of the day, the child is happy playing with his cars on the set."
1,"My kids LOOOOOVE these.  They're so cheerful and easy to grab.  They sink, so they're fun to snag by the ""tentacles"" and have numbers on them.  The variety of colors also seems to appeal to the kids.  The only bummer is how well they hold onto the water, making it a little hard to dry them out and avoid mildew and puddles on the floor when my kids want to carry them around the house (have I mentioned they love them?).  However, ours haven't mildewed yet, so fingers crossed."

It was wrapping really nicely and you can see everything it comes with. I'm hesitating to open it or keep it in mint condition and buy another one I can actually open.

1,"Ok, for a darkly introspective, sloooow movie about a deeply miserable main character, this was ok. This is a story about a girl who kills a man's family in a car accident and spends the rest of the movie fighting her own guilt and trying to make his life better. That's it. If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone."

1,"This is very light for a Feld game.  I've played other light Feld games such as Builder's Duel and The Speicherstadt but for the most part his games tend to be meatier/deeper experiences.

In this game players draw 3 cards each turn.  Each card has 3 possible uses and players determine which card is going to be used for each of the three functions that turn.  One will be used to give the player a special ability, the other to get a resource, and the last to move an animal track marker up.  In between the second and last action players also put an explorer on a board in order to surround and collect animal tiles.  These tiles are the main source of points in the game.  The game lasts until the animal track markers are at a certain level and the player with the most points wins.

I typically really like the mechanic of cards being used for multiple different purposes and having to choose which role to fit each of your 3 cards in each turn presents a lot of opportunity cost decisions that make this game, despite being reasonably light, also reasonably deep and engaging.  There's a little bit of competition and reading your opponents as everyone is playing in the same space and especially with more players there can be competition for certain aspects of the game.  That said, the game is a lot more interesting with more players.  It is fine with 2, but each player can tend to focus on their own thing and there is less interaction.

The accessibility is a great boon for this game, this is a game that is quick to get up and running with almost anybody and because it is still reasonably engaging and deep you don't sacrifice that in making a lighter game."

0,"In terms of Belly Bands, this is the only one I've tried that my dog doesn't destroy. I had to replace the bowls with some other plastic ones because of the large amount of water in the bowl. I think it's because I don't want to have the water all over the floor. I think it's because the water on the bowl is really shallow. I just put a little bit of water in the bowl and it's a good size for my dog. I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and he was skeptical at first. He loved it and put it on top of the other litter box. We bought a second one and I like it and we're using it for his litter box. It's also a good quality. We don't have to clean it every day but we do. We just leave it on the floor and the poop stays there. It's easy to put in the box and clean. It's good for cleaning the litter box but it's not a big deal. I'm sure this litter box will be great for your pet. I have a golden retriever and this collar is a great way to get her attention. I have a little old guy and it's a little big for him to wear and this collar makes it easier for him to get it. It's a great buy for him and I'm happy with it!  I would definitely buy another one. This is a great toy for your dog. It's really sturdy and very durable. My cat really likes these and the texture is great. The cats love them. They smell great."

The fuel is very compact and you can boil water from a 2 liter or larger pot.  The stove is made of high quality aluminum and the lid is very easy to open and close.  The only negative I have is that I have to press the stove to get it to zero, but I do that with my hand, not my feet.  I am very happy with this stove and recommend it to others.This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster. It is not as thick as a regular holster and the holster is pretty thin. I would recommend this holster. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My thoughts:
- This holster is very solid and good quality. I have been using it for several months and the holster seems to be very durable. It is not heavy, I would say very well made."
1,"The story flashes back and forth between the beginning of the 20th century and today; something I don't like. However, it wasn't too much of a distraction. My problem with the story is development of the characters and the total ""disappearance"" of story threads (WHAT was the purpose of the body bag on the dock and how did that play out?). There are characters that just don't make sense, like the hostility of the housekeeper (what was that all about?), the peeping tom proclivities of the butler and the bitchiness of the second wife (which wasn't even discovered until the end of the book (WHERE did that come from?)  The author needs a good editor to point out the weaknesses in his story-telling. I won't be buying the other books in the series."

She faces two big obstacles...Adam is a genius, but socially awkward and she can't tell him she has been hired to help him.  This book is Ms. Livesay's debut with Avon Impulse and I think they have found a promising author.

I definitely enjoyed this book.  It's a sweet story about accepting those we love for who they are and seeing the potential in them.  Chelsea and Adam were a cute couple.  I loved Adam and his inability to lie.  He is a genius with a form of Aspergers that makes him very literal. It was actually kind of refreshing and made him more vulnerable.  Chelsea grew up in poverty and sees her success as a way to prove she is better than her adolescent life. She has some lessons to learn about what is really important.

1,"Ever bought lettuce or spinach and, after 3 days in the fridge, find that it's turning to a slimy mess?  Got concerns about E. coli and other bacteria on your leafy greens?

If you eat salads, you NEED a salad spinner. And after trying several, I'm here to tell you this is the one you want. 1)  Put your veggies in the bowl. Pour a cup of white vinegar over it, and fill with cold water. Agitate it with your (clean, recently washed) hands and let it sit for a few minutes. 2)  Lift the basket out and pour out the vinegar / water. Fill again with cold water and agitate by hand. 3)  Lift the basket and pour out the water, then spin, spin spin. 4)  Pour out the water and wipe the remaining droplets with a paper towel. 5)  Put the basket back in, lock the spinner down, and store in the fridge. Lettuce and spinach lasts twice as long using this method than just storing in the fridge."

If I sleep through ""Pink Ball"", it is placed on the rug while he hunts for ""Blue Ball"". ""Blue Ball"" is usually dead and on the rug by about 4:12 AM (just enough time to fall back asleep if I fake slept through ""Pink Ball"". ). Well, if dumb Mommy sleeps through ""Blue Ball"" presentation then it is placed ~6 inches to the right of ""Pink Ball"" and off we go for ""Yellow Ball"". Repeat.

1,"Rebecca Royce adds her voice to this wonderful series with this book. I love returning to the world of the Black Hills Wolves. Each new story brings a new adventure.

 This book gives us the couple of Mags and Clay. When Mags returns to the pack to help her sister, Clay soon follows. She thought she could never have her mate but things soon change for Mags and Clay. I loved this couple and seeing their relationship take shape made for a nice read. The two are great together. Love is something that cannot be denied and the two face this fact and soon fight for it.

Not only do we get to watch a beautiful relationship develop but we also get to see the action and suspense with everyone trying to figure out and stop the killings. It was nice to see the other characters from past books and seeing how everyone interacts with one another.

 I enjoy how each author continues this story line but makes it their own without losing the feel of the series. I am pulled in and always want to return for more.

Well i changed to 1 star after lastnight im very disappointed with this drone after flying for about two minutes about 15 feet up it decided to drop from flight for no reason. New batteries in controller and fully charged in drone. I checked everything, no damage. Continued to fly until battery ran down every thing was ok. Took it out tonight, paired ok got it up 10 off ground everything ok so i landed it. Too it out to my driveway, pushed video button and  then pushed one button take off, it goes up and up and up, I had no control working of any kind it went up about 40 feet and drifted into a tree about 70 feet away and now my drones stuck in a tree 40 feet in the air. No way to get it down, thats too bad it only flew well a few times. By the way I'm not new to drones, I have three others that work fine. UPDATE 8/3/17 CheerWing seen my review and the problem I had with the drone. They decided to send me a new drone free of charge, surprised the heck out of me. So I decided to give the stars backfor great customer service. I couldn't ask for better. Thank you again CheerWing. I will be doing more business with them in the future, they treat their customers well.

I had to go through the instructions for it to work. I was pretty disappointed. If you want to get a solid solid product, you have to take it apart first. It was hard to get the screws to tighten.

1,"It is now my go to litter for my cats.  I am traditioning away from the regular Tidy Cat clumping litter in the 35 lb buckets. Among the litter boxes I currently have are two identical litter boxes side by side, one with regular clumping litter and the other with the lightweight litter.  And my experience is that the Tidy Cat clumping litter has more dust then the Tidy Cat lightweight litter, and tracks less.  My cats don't show a preference from one over the other, but lugging around 35 lb buckets is making me make a preference.  This lightweight litter actually seems to clump harder.  And when you have to scoop through 3-4"" of litter to remove the clumps, the lightweight litter makes a big difference.  In the past, I have kept 200-300 pounds of litter on hand, now I can have half that weight on hand, which is easier on me.  And yes, litter tracks.  I don't care what type you get, they will manage to track it.  I don't smell urine odor, but feces odor depends on whether the cat decides to bury it or not, or how well."

I was able to fit an 8x10 rolled up tarp, mini sleeping bag, hammock, amongst all my other backpacking needs with plenty of room to spare. It appears to be waterproof/resistant but I haven't tested it yet. The 3 compartments are very useful for items quickly needed such as flashlights first aid kits etc. I did have to adjust the belt/chest straps a little but afterwards it fit perfectly. I've read reviews stating that it only fits larger people which is not true. My waist is 32"" and it fits perfect. Only minor thing was the drawstring which was a quick fix. Simply replace it with paracord and you're gtg."

Cons - Wiggles when hit. the two I got are at different heights (off by .5mm). I just put some folded paper to raise one. One of them shipped without the screw to attach the base. I just used one I had laying around instead. The led flashed at night VERY BRIGHTLY if the monitors are on. I covered up the LEDs with two layers of duct tape.

1,"""Ape House"" is a light read that attempts to open the animal world to us by bringing the Bonobos Apes to life in an original way.

This is a story about a family of Bonobos, their caretaker scientist Isabel Duncan and a down to earth reporter John Thigpen. I will cover the plotting in a few words, it begins with the primate language laboratory being bombed and Isabel left badly injured, severe enough to end up in the trauma ward of the closest hospital. The Bonobos fall into the hands of a porn producer and are locked up in a house with cameras broadcasting their every move on cable television. Reporter John Thigpen covers the story while his personal life is on a down turn, his home life it is about to take a drastic change. The plotting gets meatier when Isabel is released from hospital and teams up with John to find out who targeted the laboratory, for what reason and what has happened to her family of apes.

The story explores in a far-fetched semi captivating manner, the issue of animal rights from the point of view of activists, scientists and the public. The plot takes a meandering course with a bit of action here and there mostly done by the humans, there are also subtle references to sexual activities amongst the apes and their unique methods of communication. I found this part satire and part morality driven tale was presented to us by a cast of lackluster and easily forgotten characters, maybe if the Bonobos had been given a greater role it would have left a more lasting impression. Unfortunately the book started strong just to peter out by the end, I was disappointed when the tale did not capture the apes' behaviour, gestures and emotions in a more detailed fashion.

Although the story was not what I had anticipated, I nevertheless enjoyed the change."

1,"The description says it will get you to 120 PSI. In my experience, it's nearly impossible to get the pressure in over 70 psi with this pump. Good enough for triage, but not ideal.

Based on other positive reviews, it seems that three things are possible:

1. User error by me (I don't *think* that's the case, but i'm not so arrogant as to rule it out). I would guess I am at least slightly physically stronger than the average user of this pump, so I don't think that's the issue either.

3. Widespread dishonesty/pay-to-review arrangements (I haven't looked for evidence of this, but I have seen other unrelated products fall victim to this).

1,"Kids enjoyed building the toys, and had minimal frustrations, but there is little fun after the initial build.  It does not necessarily encourage free thinking and creativity nearly as much as other building toys, but it is a good starter set for that type of thinking.  After done, you are kind of stuck with two big toys that don't do much beyond standard toys that are already built.  Not knocking it really, but just how my kids work.  I think at this price, there should be more creative thinking."

1,"Ordinary action flicks suffer from the affliction of predictability.  We all know that the gun wielding tough guy will systematically destroy all of his enemies and heroically beat the boss after a more difficult battle at the end.  If you are tired of these kinds of movies, then watch Lucky Number Slevin instead.

What transpires in this movie is completely unpredictable, and it never ceases to be entertaining.  Part of the fun that you have when watching this movie is following the constantly changing and twisting plot.  So I'm not going to ruin any of your viewing pleasure by giving it away.  But I will say it involves the relationship between mob bosses, the stakes of risky gambling, assasins, thugs, and innocent people being caught in the crossfire.  As you can see, it has all of the staples of an action flick.

Superb character development and visual effects make this a must-see action movie with a great plot twist."

1,"The radio offers pretty solid features. I just had it installed and  pretty happy for the most part. The Bluetooth is excellent, I've had to play with the EQ because it won't sound right out the box, but once you adjust the audio settings, it's a beast. I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

Rating - I gave it a 4 only because the sufficient lack of USB charge. It's pretty useless for charging for me."

0,"Our three dogs love this toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put together. There's a hole in the bottom that is the plastic part. The toy is made of plastic and it's hard to put together. There are two pieces of plastic in the center that are a bit difficult to put together. I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing issue or just a design issue. The plastic part is pretty strong. It's easy to put together and does not come apart easily. It's not hard to put together, but it's not sturdy.

1,"i have been using this DVD for over 5 years.  i reach for it when i don't want to jump around.  the movements are slow and steady, deceptive. it takes time, proper breathing, and strong core to achieve the effortless grace.  i still haven't mastered the ab work out (the last part).

**About the workout:

I've owned several workout DVDs with the name ballet in the title.  IMO Ballet Conditioning feels more like taking a ballet class than the others because it is pure ballet, not pilates and not yoga.  The other ballet workout DVDs all have pilates and yoga.

Also, the workout concentrates on core and lower body strength, both vital to ballet dancers.  If you want equal attention to upper body/arms/shoulders, you won't find here.

**About the music:

i mute the dvd and use the CD ""Adagio by Herbert Von Karajan"".

Ballet + adagio classical music = peace + calm + relaxation

this dvd is the best when i need to forget about the world and just breathe and concentrate on movements."
1,"I purchased My Pal Violet as a gift for my nearly year old niece because my son has loved his My Pal Scout to pieces. Violet has been an incredible hit with my niece.

She has short violet and white fur with a plastic light up ""dog tag"" with Violet painted on it. She shouldn't be washed in the washing machine but you can spot clean her a little. The white fur doesn't easily release stains after a while, and beleive me, she will accumulate stains because she will be played with all the time.

Violet runs on 3 AAA batteries that are held within a plastic, screwed shut compartment inside of her velcroed back. We keep a small screw driver with our extra batteries for the toy so that changing them out is not such a problem.

She comes with a USB cable because it is a customizable toy if you own a computer. I will say that the better your internet connection, the better off you will be with this toy. Leapfrog doesn't have the easiest to navigate site. It is not user intuitive and usually takes a couple of tries to get any of our Leapfrog toys customized. The sync function at the end is an especial pain.

Violet has an ""on/off"" paw, a bedtime music paw, a musical paw with popular children's songs, and a paw that makes Violet talk with customizable phrases. You can make the bedtime music play for longer amounts of time by pressing it multiple times. You can customize what children's music the other paw plays. The remaining paw is conversation for your child and it is priceless to have the toy say ""I love you, (insert child's name)"". It also is customized with info such as you child's favorite food and color. Some of the conversation can be a little nonsensical but that is part of the fun, I suppose.

If it were a breeze to program and a little more educational, I would give it 5 stars. It is a great toy though and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for any child."

As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life.  That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth.  If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."

UPDATE: I have apparently the some of the  older models (bought 2 years ago) These NEW ones don't do what the old ones did. They only have ""on"" and ""dim to bright"" modes. My old ones had THREE settings. ON...dim to bright when motion is detected AND totally off and then bright when motion is detected. In the WINTER I need the last mode. I HATE when companies ""improve"" things. Probably due to the fact that people couldn't figure out how to use a bent paper clip to change the modes."

I'm sure the same goes for females with the male actors.  I can handle the occasional ""chick flick"", but this one just had a bad story with annoying characters.  Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxxx are really lame in this movie, as are most of the characters and situations that are squeezed in to give all the stars enough face time.  I thought it was interesting to see Julia Roberts in an army uniform, never thought I would see that.  The movie doesn't even really end with that much of a ""feel good"" ending.  I thought it was comical that someone as gorgeous as Jessica Biel could possibly be a frustrated single that can't get a date.  I don't think Jessica Biel has ever had to go without a date ever.  The movie has plenty of attractive people, but the movie itself is pretty bad."
1,"The best part of this scene is the cannon that swivels on the turret and the Tauntaun.  Let's face it-Tauntauns do not grow on trees in the Lego world and are exclusive to this set.  The fact that it also comes with two Snowtroopers, the Han Solo and two Rebels means 5 minifigs and said Tauntan for $40+ the other portions of the scene.  A pretty good value.  On it's own this scene can clearly shows a solid Hoth scene-but is by no means huge.

As part of a larger Hoth scene, this becomes essential.  I have added it to the Limited Edition Echo Base 7879, Hoth Wampa Cave 8089, Hoth Rebel Base 7666 one additional Echo Base, two Motorized At-At's (10178), other dark gray and white misc pieces AND white dog toy stuffing for quite the display.  All of you may not have these sets but feel free to copy!  Looks amazing but takes up some space.

If you are in to Lego scenes from the original trilogy, this is a must."

At the beginning I disliked Kirk as much as TJ, but Rain Carrignton has a way redeeming the characters and make you fall in love with them. He saved Malcolm and gave him a better life, despite the unconventional beginning to their relationship. My heart was breaking for Malcolm and the hand that he was dealt in life, but he surprised me by showing his strength and actually becoming the hero in various ocassions.

1,"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup."

I decided that I was already going to be sweating up a storm going for a run, so what was a little leaky water on top of that? LOL Turns out, my bottles don't leak at all. I couldn't be happier with this belt. It has a nice elastic band that is adjustable so you can get a perfect fit. So refreshing since I previously owned a camelbak from HELL that would not adjust down small enough to fit me once I lost weight. ANYWAYS, If you have the misfortune of getting leaky bottles, I would recommend contacting the seller. I really don't think its a matter of a bad product as much as the occasional faulty one. I'm totally happy and would absolutely recommend this to friends."
1,"This bike does seem sturdy, but came with so many paint chips!! Pretty disappointing. Some chips appear to have already been badly touched up with not-quite-matching touch up paint, and others aren't fixed at all. I read this in other reviews for this bike, so I guess it's quite common.
The chipped paint didn't occur in transit, as the bike was very well protected in foam, cardboard and plastic.
The bike still functions and went together fine, but don't expect the paint to be in good condition.
I snapped a few pictures for examples, but there were a lot more than what's pictured."

I will be buying another pair. It was very comfortable. I ordered the white one and it is exactly what I wanted. I wish I could have gotten a different color. I do not think it will be long enough to wear for long periods of time. I hope the color is a little brighter in the photo. I am 5'9"" and weigh 160 lbs.

I wear a size 6 and these fit perfectly. I will order a size 7 if I can find a size larger. The material is good. The sole is very soft and comfortable. I wear a 9. 5 and these fit perfect. I wear them all day and they are a little tight on my feet. I have trouble with the heel but these shoes are not going to hurt my feet. I will buy a second pair of these shoes if I can find them.

My cats are medium-sized and this Litter Robot is plenty large for them. There is only 'life after Litter Robot', because manual scooping is not only messy but a waste of time. I usually only have to get rid of the bag in the tray once a week with two cats. This Litter Robot II was allegedly designed by an engineer, and it shows, too."

1,"This is a robust, well-made chain cleaning device of debatable utility.

Here's how it works. You fill it with soapy water or degreaser. Then you attach it to your chain and attempt to backpedal. The gears complain and water sloshes out from both sides because it has much more friction than you expected. You eventually find a hand position that keeps it stable and doesn't repeatedly derail the chain, then doggedly run it through.

The result is a clean-looking chain. The outside part. The inside part that actually matters is mostly untouched. This, after probably two minutes of running the chain in both directions.

Here's what actually worked: a bunch of cheap microfiber cloth towels (they don't disintegrate like cheap cotton towels), WD-40 bike degreaser, and Finish Line's ""Gear Floss."" Put WD-40 (or practically any other degreaser) on the microfiber, hold the chain through it, and run it through until it's clean on the outside. Then, for each big link, double up a piece of gear floss and pull it through. Do the small links too if you want. Total time is about three minutes. It's cleaner, faster, cheaper, and more thorough than this thing.

If you really want the chain to sparkle, spend a moment to undo the quick-link (probably) holding it together. Then put it in a soda bottle with ten or twelve ounces of citrus degreaser and shake for a minute or two. Short of an ultrasonic cleaning or soaking the chain in petroleum solvents and scrubbing it with a brush, that's as clean as it's going to get."

First, it is translated into smooth modern English, which, while not conveying every subtlety of Greek, will nontheless help the present-day reader through this long work. Second, the price is under $10. Third, there is an excellent map collection at the back showing the ancient world as we see it and as Herodotus saw it. The notes, bibliography, appendices, indexes, timeline and glossary all make this a great resource for the student or casual reader. There is enough mention of content in all the other reviews. I just wanted to point out the advantages of this edition."

1,"Billy Elliot is an 11 year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class (meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike).

This is the classic ""family doesn't initially understand,"" ""teacher believes in him,"" ""screws up audition but spirit carries him through"" type movie.  It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out.

The transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day, which seemed jarring.

The beginning of Swan Lake, with Billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance, 10 years or so later, was a real ""feel good"" part of the movie."

I wish it had a little more furniture for the little ones to play with.  I also wish the plastic was a little more solid.  I wish there were more lights and sounds.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's very small.  You'd think it would be too small for our little ones to play with.  The dollhouse is definitely bigger than I expected it to be.  It's also made of wood that is easier to store.  I'm not sure if the wood is going to be durable, but it's sturdy enough to keep my grand daughter entertained for a long time.  I don't know if the wood is going to last as long as I thought it would, but it's definitely made of wood that will last for years to come.

These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.

Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?

This kind of movie fits my sense of humor - kinda silly and gross in places, but still a lot of laughs.  The humor is definitely 1980s with some pop-culture references that were fun to me, but would probably go over the heads of my grown children.  It was also fun to see some of the actors that I hadn't seen in a few years.  Even my wife, who wasn't looking forward to it, was laughing in some places.  Not a cinematic masterpiece, but a fun time."

1,"This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value."

1,"Bought this camera about a month ago,  what an awesome peice of electronics. Bought the HDMI cable to view on my 50"" HDTV, very nice, I think the picture is as good as some of the HD shows on TV or even better. For the price, I feel the HDMI cable should come with it, but oh well what ya gonna do?  Camera is so light weight that it's hard for me to keep steady while walking, but then I'm a bit heavy and not so light on my feet. The access wheel on the LCD is a bit awkward but not bad once you get use to it. I always tend to spin it past where I want to be. Bought a Tiffen enhancing filter kit and man did it bring out the colors. Built in mic is so sensitive I can here myself breath and can hear the hard disk motor when very quiet, definitely need to get the Canon DM-50 mic.  Not sure which software suite to buy even though the software that comes with it is good enough to transfer video files and still images. Don't like the idea of having to plug in the charger each time I want to transfer files.  All in all I feel it is a great hard drive camera with nice features, however I should of waited another couple months for the new HF-10. Now that camera seems awesome, with basicly no moving parts and removable flash memory to transfer files, 12X optical and 30P - WOW !!  Next time !!"
1,This is a big hit with my three cats. Originally I used this scratcher as a prop for my pet photography so I did not allow my cats to use it before the photo shoot so it would still be new. After the shoot I put it down in the room and immediately one of my cats used it to scratch on it and then slept next to it and didn't want to leave. This is a nice design and the other cardboard products from PetFusion are great too.

1,"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.

Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper. By the end of the third book I had more than 100 bookmarks."

1,"This book is definitely not a ""bit of light reading for your spare time"", but it is very difficult to find a biological concept that they do not cover in this book.  This is the book we use in AP Bio.  What makes it difficult is the fact that there is so much chemistry, but that is by nature of the fact that you take chemistry the year after bio, not anything that has to do with the book.  This book makes biology fun and interesting.  It has detailed explainations of things and gives clear, colorful diagrams that are very useful.  You could use this book as a biology encyclopedia or use it to teach yourself any topic pertaining to bio.  I would really recommend at LEAST a year of high school chemistry before taking this class if you don't want to stress yourself out trying to learn the chemical topics they present to you.  Not that they don't do a good job, it can just be too much though."

It's strong and well constructed, holding up to being gnawed and tossed around by a pretty large guy. There are no small parts for little mouths to swallow and choke on.

My bun tends to ignore his toys for a while (as in a few weeks) before deciding to play with them, and may even decide to ignore them again. That's definitely been the case with this toy, but the quality and the fact that it's made right here in the U.S. without questionable materials makes it worth the cost."

1,"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings ."

The only glitch is that my toilet seat is now raised up from the front by about an inch and does not sit flush on the pot rim.
(It's a Kohler pot + seat) - This could be due to the design of the toilet seat and the way it locks in.

 If I take that out of it, it is a fun love story.  Katherine pretends to be someone else when she meet Kirk while trying to steal his horse with her sister.  Katherine is supposed to marry Kurt's brother Ben.  But I love a strong female lead and Katherine doesn't disappoint in that regard, and the mystery of when Kurt will find out the truth keeps you engaged.  But Katherine and Kurt are fun together and this is a good love story.

1,"Money. What everyone wants. And when they get it, all they want is more. That is the basic concept behind Confidence. Jake Vig (Edward Burns) is a con man that makes his living by scamming people out of their money. Accompanied by his three buddies (Louis Lombardi, Paul Giamatti, and Brian Van Holt), the crew moves from city to city tricking people and stealing their money. But when Big Al (Louis Lombardi) turns up dead after one of the scams, they get into something they never expected. It turns out that the money they just stole belongs to someone who is referred to as simply, King (Dustin Hoffman). Vig goes to talk to the King and is hired to run a heist to get back the money for King. Edward Burns plays a smooth talking, very convincing young man... and he plays him extraordinarily. It was very refreshing to see him handle the lead role so well because he hasn't always looked comfortable with it. Dustin Hoffman also does some outstanding acting (as usual) playing a sex-crazed man with ADHD and obviously aware of how powerful and rich he is. There are numerous amounts of heist and con movies around right now, but this film tells the way people feel about money very well, while still keeping your eyes glued to the screen. Confidence is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that has also hopped to the top of the to buy list for me."

1,"By 2001 the resurgence of slasher movies had fortunately died down and audiences were in the mood for something new. Jeepers Creepers is a return to the old-fashioned monster movies in the style of classic Universal. Those were movies built on suspense and atmosphere rather than gore and multiple kills.

Justin Long and Gina Philips play Darry and Trish, a pair of argumentative siblings who are traveling home through the Florida backwaters for spring break. Along the way they are terrorized by an unseen figure driving a ugly truck. Darry sees the figure dumping what appears to be dead bodies into a pipe by an abandoned church. In a moment of agonizing plot contrivance Darry turns around and heads back to find out what's really going on, unawares that he'll give the villain a taste of his fear, thus making him a marked man.

Victor Salva layers the movie with homosexual and incestuous subtext, while keeping the monster in the dark for the most part, building fear and mystery about him. The Creeper is a great villain and Salva builds an intriguing mythology about him.

The swift running time (the credits roll at the 85 minute mark) prevents things from getting deep or expansive but the sequel builds upon this world and is actually a better movie despite the hate. On its own Jeepers Creepers is an effective but superficial. Plenty of points for being original however.

The Blu-ray is in 1.85:1 1080p and it is an improvement on the DVD, however there are just a few too many scenes shot in soft focus which don't give it much of a pop. The black levels are impressive though. It sounds better in DTS HD-MA, and all the extras from the DVD have been ported over."

1,"Update (8/2/2014):
It has been two years and the switch is still working great.

Update:
I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.
By the way don't bother calling the ""technical service number"", they can only tell you to send the product into their warranty center.  Write them an email at info@leviton.com

I have several books on addiction and, for me, this one bridged the gap between my ""my Higher Power"" and Jesus Christ.  Church groups, self help books and bible studies have all contributed to my understanding of addictions, but this book nailed the root cause as Sin-
disease without judgment or shame.  It resonated with my soul."

1,"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid.
Newsflash!
Neither are today's kids.

I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around.

I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be.

However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here.

I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers.

I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think.

Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER!

It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children.
Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self.

It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter.

Play with your child when you offer your child the toy.

There is lots to do with it! We like it very much.
I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring.
I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading!
Mom of five sons here! :)

1,A good show covering a period before TOS. As a fan of TOS I had a hard time watching the spin off shows.  I found myself liking the Enterprise series despite my skepticism.

0,"Aspiring sexual dysfunction Psychologist Bethany Merrick, an investigator in the town of Westlake, Texas, has a hard time finding a woman who is willing to have sex with a man she has met in a bar. It takes a long time for a man to come to terms with his feelings for Bethany. And with a man who has a secret crush on her, Bethany has no idea he is doing anything to make her feel happy. But when the man meets her, she will have to come to terms with what is happening.

The first thing you will notice is the way this book makes you feel. The scenes are real, but the sex scenes are not. Instead, Bethany is thrust into a situation where the man is not willing to give up and she feels no need to be forced to give up.

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

Honestly, I can't recommend it highly enough."

1,"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.  I think if you write one more ""Hutch behind a desk"" story I may have to give up on you."

1,"Until Brueggeman's Old Testament Theology was published in 1997, this was  the largest dose one could find in one place. The articles in this  collection were all previously published in journals and other collections,  but tracking them all down would be a difficult task. Therefore, the  volume is very worthwhile. Even in the light of his most recent  publications it is still a useful collection for a couple of other reasons. First, these articles were produced over a period of a couple of decades,  so the attentive reader can observe Brueggeman's biblical theology as it  developed over his career. Second, many of the articles are sustained  treatments of individual texts, the likes of which do not appear in his  recent Old Testament Theology. Most importantly, these essays reveal the  increasing impact of contemporary literary studies on Old Testament  Theology. For all of these reasons this collection is a treasure and may  be considered a prerequisite for reading Brueggeman's ""Old Testament  Theology:  Testimony, Advocacy, and Dispute."

1,"I was given an ARC copy of this to read and review by the author, however I enjoyed it so much I purchased a copy for myself.

This is book two in this new series by Georgette, however it can be read as a standalone. There are brief appearances from the first couple in the series so while it works on its own, I would suggest reading the first book anyway.

Cadence is half werewolf, half dragon. She never knew her father and was raised by her mother with no impact from her father or his family. Since her wolf was most dominant she was able to hide that she was half dragon, however she is changing. Her wolf is gone and her dragon side is beginning to take over. She is unable to hide it any longer and since dragon births are on the decline, she has no choice but to register and subject herself to a forced mating with a complete stranger. However fate was at work when her best friend, Daisy, happened to meet a dragon as he was being ejected by her aunts mating agency. Some quick thinking gets them both in the same room and that is where the real fun begins.

I love this world Georgette has created as well as the two sides to the dragons. The ice dragons and the fire dragons and the war that has always been simmering between them is so interesting. Cadence is an ice dragon and Orion is a fire dragon. They should hate each other, not be falling in love.

This one had action, forbidden romance and a lot of fun moments. One of Georgettes best books in my opinion and I definitely recommend to fans of paranormal romance."

0,"I've been advised by a few friends and family members that I need to make a purchase before I can get my hands on a new pair.  The basic instruction is to take a large bag with you and put it in the trunk of the car.  This is a great way to put things in your pocket or to keep your things in the car and on your feet.  I will say that I have never had a problem with the metal bags.  It's very easy to put things in your car and on the ground.

1,"I have been using this product for more than two weeks now. In that time, I've had an opportunity to evaluate both the quality of the product and the overall usability. In creating this review I've considered both the type of material used in making the product as well as the overall fit and finish. I've also considered how well the product meets my needs and whether there are any shortcomings or particular advantages in using this product.

For this particular product, the type of material used in the manufacture and creation of the product seems to be of very good quality. One must consider that for any product of this type there is a balance between the type of material used and the cost that is to be passed on to the consumer. I think for this product that balance has been met fairly well and I believe that the product will meet the expectations of most buyers.

With regard to the fit and finish of this particular product, I believe it to be about average for the products of similar make or style. That is to say that it is not of poor or moderate craftsmanship/finish nor is it something that I would rate as outstanding. The quality of the piece is such that I feel it is a good value for the money.

Finally, as with many products of this type, the value that a consumer sees is dependent on the expectation. When I ordered this product my expectations were moderate, especially because of the price. In an age where we demand low price but often want high quality, it is often best if we expect moderate to good quality instead. I did that with this product as was pleasantly surprised to find that the quality was at least good, if not just a tad bit better than good. For that reason, and those set out above, I'd make a recommendation to buy this product."

1,"These heavy duty, kitchen scissors have many functions but if you have arthritis in your fingers the handles are a wee bit too tight. And, I was surprised that the scissors aren't quite sharp enough. The scissors come with a magnetic sheath which I attach to the side of my refrigerator. However, the magnet isn't quite strong enough & when I put the scissors in, everything slides down a little bit then stops. Because the magnet isn't strong enough, it works better on the side of the fridge rather than on the door where opening/closing the door constantly jars it. **The scissors have many functions:
They come apart & can be used separately for slicing. At the top of one handle is a bottle opener. The top of the other handle can be used as a screw driver. With the blades joined you can open jar lids or crack nuts between the handles. One blade doubles as a vegetable peeler. The other blade's serrated edge can be used to scale fish."

1,"I was reluctant to try this process, feeling a bit snobby as a mid-career artist with a BFA and MFA in painting. I was leery of sappiness of this program. But finding myself frustrated with my work, feeling too tightly wound and over analytical, it was just the anecdote I needed. In some ways this program is the counterbalance to my MFA program which I finished 15 yrs ago and left me firmly planted in my brain - thinking, thinking, thinking - over thinking. This book helped me to create again through my intuition and to trust my instincts. I'm certainly not suggesting that thought and analysis are not important integral parts of art making which is at its core problem solving. But I do agree with the premise that artistic ""block"" stems from living too much in your brain.

The book gives you simple weekly and daily exercises that are reflective and thoughtful. There is plenty of talk of ""god"" or ""spirit"" ""source"" or ""universe"" but it also clarifies that you may simply substitute in ""creative intuition"" or ""muse"" or some such term if you are not comfortable with the religious undertones. For me this was uncomfortable at first, given that I was totally in my rational head, but this sort of leap of faith is just what I needed. Some of the exercises did not apply as well to me, but I can almost always find some benefit, even if small. Many are cathartic. The daily process of the morning pages is both a grueling task and a revelation.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this process for any creative person, no matter what ""level"" you have achieved thus far. There is always room to grow and learn, and this is a provocative and enriching experience."

1,"Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

I have been transitioning him  slowly on a graduated mix;  I have noticed that his stools, while still formed, have been a lot softer on the Iams mix.  Some of this I realize has to do with any kind of dietary change,  so I will wait a little longer before giving my final opinion on that. This product lost only one star because the grain size makes this food a little harder to eat than others (including Eukanuba large breed, which he has tried before).  Other than that, it is a good product at a fair price and keeping my dog nourished at his high activity level.

Update:  dog still likes it and his poops are nice and firm, but the problem is that the grain size is so large, it is clogging my auto feeder. For that reason alone, I cannot buy it again."

1,"I'm a fairly particular with my can selection, within a budget.  I listen to music on my cans everyday and these headphones sound better the older they get.  I've had them for over 2 years now.  There was a break in period of about 50 hours. They replaced a pair of Sennheiser 595.  They are very different from the Senns, (which are great headphones as well, just a brighter sound.)  The one caveat is that they are difficult to drive and a headphone amp takes care of that nicely.  I listen to all types of music, but my headphone time tends to be Jazz and vocals and the AKG's don't disappoint.  Also, if you have a large head, as I do:)  you should be careful with these.  They fit, but barely.  Happy listening."

1,"One cannot ask for a better product than this exercise pen.  Although I did not purchase this playpen for a puppy, it served its purpose exceptionally well for a mother cat and her five newborn kittens.  The purpose was to keep them isolated from my other cats while they were being cared for by momma and so that they could not wonder off and become lost prior to their eyes opening.

This playpen is built strong and durable, with two zippered opening on the side.  The netting on each opening can be rolled up and vecroed into place.  The entire top can be zippered off and on, providing easy access to reach your puppy or kittens/cats.  Two sturdy pouches on the side is available for grooming products and accessories.  There is also two net pockets.

One of the nicest attributes of this playpen is;  it can be folded and broken down quickly and stored in the storage pouch that comes with it.  Portable and easily moved by two people, even when erected.  Durable enough to be placed outside to allow your pets to get that fresh air environment.

I highly recommend this product if you're looking for something to assist in isolating your pets during their younger days.  For the price, you will not be disappointed."

We have a small toy breed so this was the perfect size for her. Very easy to clean and fold. Love that it's so compact. We went on a long road trip so I had filled it while the car was moving. It's sturdy and has the little handle which makes it easy to grip and hold. I prefer this to the other travel bowl we purchased. So far it remains intact and hopefully stays that way! If you have a big dog and need something bigger this is definitely not for you. I'd recommend this for smaller dogs. However if you need something just to hold water while hiking, this would work for any size dog."

The story is well told and the locations are beautiful.  The acting is great.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a great film to watch.  A must have for any horror fan.I have watched this movie since it was first released on VHS and loved it.  I have watched it many times and it still holds up to the test of time.  The story was a bit different then the first movie and the acting was good.  I was a little disappointed in the ending.  I was hoping for a good ending.  I don't really know what the ending was about but I thought it was a good ending.  It was a very good movie and I am happy to have it on DVD.  The movie was very well done and was very well acted.

1,"I obtained an advance reader's copy of this book some time ago and had several false starts trying to read it.
My first attempt was on an Orlando to LAX flight - I literally had nothing else to do but open the book and read.
Somehow, I just couldn't get into it.  Some books draw you in and hold on to you even after you're finished.  This is certainly not one of those types of books.

My second attempt was in a car dealer's waiting room.  I opted to wait for my car.  Due to an unexpected delay finding a specific part, my estimates one hour wait turned into a 3 hour wait.  Again, I resumed reading this book yet couldn't manage to make myself turn the pages.  I read a couple more chapters but still couldn't muster enough interest to continue.

Then I find myself on another coast to coast flight, this time in a comfy seat up front.  Near the endpoint of the flight, my seat-neighbor asks me how the book is...I told him that I have tried to read it several times but I can't seem to garner enough interest.  I mentioned that I fell asleep twice trying to force myself to read the pages.  I also told him of my plan to review it on Amazon and that it would not be fair to review the work until I have properly read it.

All of that said, I finally did sit down and read the book.  Yes, the first third seems to plod along.  The book does pick up some, probably because I developed a form of literary Stockholm syndrome being a slave to its pages.

Overall - the novel's plot development is slow.  The characters, and there were too many of them, were not especially memorable for me.  The whole thing was predictable.  I would not recommend this book."

The larger pan also, doesn't have to be emptied as often.  So, I will be replacing the smaller pan with another Lock-N-Litter Jumbo Pan from Amazon ($4 more in store)"

0,"For no other reason than that it's an interesting and intriguing history.

The movie has a couple of interesting twists and turns, including the bizarre, mysterious, and often very moving ""The Eye of the Dragon.""

I think it's going to be a fun movie for adults and a bit creepy for children, especially if you are a fan of dragons.

And I love the ending.

I can't say enough good things about this movie, so if you want to see it for yourself, you'll probably want to see it for yourself.

I enjoyed it, and am glad I bought it.I love the show. It was a good way to start my day and to make my day better. It was a fun show and I had a great time with it.

1,"Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet.  Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic)."

1,"Crate was delivered promptly and packaging was in good condition.  The plastic pan is good quality and it was in good condition.  The only issues that I saw are the number of doors and the thickness of the wire cage.  The fact that this cage only has two door eliminates you being able to put two pups in or take two pups out of the kennel with ease.  You would have to remove the center divider.  The other potential issue is the lightweight gauge steel that the kennel is made out of.  Our two GSD pups get excited when we come home and jump on the kennel walls.  The walls are flex enough that the pups can actually open the side door when they jump on it.  For the price point though, this kennel was a really good deal."

1,"Poor, misguided, drunken Superhero Hancock, seems to have lost his way along with his memory. Lonely and destroying more than he seems to save, not caring what anyone thinks or how they view his escapades, Hancock drinks, curses and half-heartedly saves those in danger.  Among those he saves is Ray, an advertising and marketing guy, who attempts to change Hancock's image so that the world will value him as a ""true"" hero.  With new purpose, a new attitude, and a new outfit, Hancock finds the answers to a lot of questions that he has been searching for (including who and what he is), from an unlikely and surprising source (another of his kind).

While some may not like the ending, if you really think about it, what other outcome could there be, where everyone would be happy? Those who are immortal and will live forever will eventually have the ending that we all want, it will just take patience.  The peace and calm that Hancock finds shows us his true spirit.  After all, what is waiting another few years to find complete happiness, for someone who waited 80 years to discover the truth about who he is?"

It's very sad.I remember when I was a kid, I used to watch this movie on TV, and I was a little confused by it.  I remember watching it with my friends and my grandkids.  I had never seen this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I was a little worried that they would find out the truth behind it, but I was a little disappointed.  I don't know why the people who did this didn't get this movie, but I guess I just didn't expect it to be so funny.  I guess it was supposed to be funny, but I guess it was more like ""One More Time"" and that would have made it more interesting.  I guess it was just a little too far fetched, but it was worth watching.  I think it was really good.  I think that people who are not interested in the movie should watch the movie and not buy it.

1,"""Buddhism"" implies a doctrine, and for centuries the various sects of Buddhism has paid lip-service to the skepticism, iconoclasm, and open-mindedness of Buddhism while reciting their lineage to prove their authority, prostrating themselves to statues, requiring obedience to spiritual masters, insisting their way is the right way, and promoting metaphysical ideas that Buddha Gotama would have regarded as irrelevant distractions.
As he did in BUDDHISM WITHOUT BELIEFS, Stephen Batchelor cuts through the mindless dogma and gets to the core of Buddha's teachings.  This time he has written a more personal document, starting with his experiences as a Tibetan, then Zen monk, leaving the monastic life and marrying, and searching for the historical Buddha and his teachings.  It is a compelling story.  It is not for those who want to cling to comforting beliefs, but for those who seek liberating new perspectives.  I myself have been involved with both Zen and Tibetan, and felt that their doctrines conflicted with the Buddha's teaching.  Batchelor is a breath of fresh air who cannot and should not be ignored.
Ignore what you are taught.  The truth is in there."

0,"Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

The supporting cast is solid, and it's worth the watch.  Highly recommended.I was excited to see this movie.  The reviews said it was a great movie, and it was.  However, it is a little like the first one.  This movie has a lot of sex scenes, but it is not very realistic.  The sex scenes are very graphic, and the action scenes are very stupid.  I just didn't get it.  It is definitely a bad movie, but it's not that bad.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not a good movie.  I guess it's a good movie, but the acting is not good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.I really enjoyed the movie.  It's a funny movie.  I can't wait for the next one.  The acting is good.  I'd recommend it to anyone.I am a huge fan of this series.  I love it and I would recommend it to anyone.  It's not a bad series but it's not one of my favorite.  I love all the characters.  The series is good and I think that all the actors are great.  It's a great show and I love it.  The show is very"
1,"I hoped that the problem of undersized recoil pads was solved since most of the reviews are a few years old. Turns out, it is sized perfectly for how it is designed. This Pachmayr recoil pad is only 4.600 inches tall, and the original pad on my new 1895 is about 4.730 inches tall. The Pachmayr pad is sized so that you can cut about 1/2 inch off the stock and install the new butt pad with no change to the length of pull. I'm not willing to cut up my stock just yet, so I'll be exchanging this for a grind-to-fit Limbsaver."

1,"These are nice clippers. I'm not a professional, but shave my dog down regularly, and have tried  a number of different products. These clippers are fine, and they work nicely. What I'm not so sure about is the price. I'd suggest two other options:

For professional use, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oster-A5-Turbo-2-Speed-Professional-Animal-Clipper/dp/B000LRN31A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oster A5 Turbo 2-Speed Professional Animal Clipper</a>&nbsp;has been the gold standard for grooming professionals for decades. And since it sells for less than these, I'd select that first for professional usage.

For home use, I don't really notice any difference between this one and my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Andis-EasyClip-Pro-Animal-7-Piece-Detachable-Blade-Clipper-Kit-Pet-Grooming-MBG-2-22690/dp/B00UT3F31O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Andis EasyClip Pro-Animal 7-Piece Detachable Blade Clipper Kit, Pet Grooming, MBG-2 (22690)</a>. It works exactly the same, and also feels like a high quality clipper (way better than the cheap Wahl human/home clippers I have). It's not the highest-end Andis clipper (they have ones that cost more which are designed for professional settings), bit it feels and works every bit as good as this one for me. It's only one speed, but I don't see the need for two speeds for most uses anyway. That Andis clipper is about half the price of this one, and includes a case, and four-piece comb set (#1-4). If you want to use combs with this one, you'll pay more for something like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wahl-Professional-Animal-Stainless-Steel-Guide-Combs-3390-100/dp/B002RBWL1G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wahl Professional Animal Stainless Steel Guide Combs #3390-100</a>, which I'm sure is nice... but it's not included.

Also, note that there are two difference blade sizes for Wahl clippers. The ones designed for animal usage have longer combs which do not fit the cheaper (and not awesome) home Wahl clippers that many people may have. The animal ones are interchangeable with Andis (I used my Andis combs on this one for testing).

Anyway, this is a good clipper... but wouldn't be my first choice for the price."

1,"I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective."

1,"I think Seinfeld rates on most peoples lists as one of the greatest comedies of all time. I rank Seinfeld in my top 5. I was holding off buying this set as it was insanely expensive for a very long time, but with the deal amazon had I just had to have it. I have not been disappointed one bit. The extras including the dvd and the coffee table book are all excellent. If your a Seinfeld fan and do not own this then you really are not a true fan."
1,"I've had this one on my TBR list for a while and when it went on sale for 99 cents it was time to one click and read. The free sample was intriguing and it made me really curious as to what happened that separated this sexy biker from his little girl and her mom. Fighting to Stay is a book about a woman who always runs away from trouble or anything uncomfortable in her life and while I understand her reasoning, I don't agree with her immature thought processes.
Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.

1,"We have it on our balcony at the far end. We leave the door open, because the air in Los Angeles is toxic and prevents flying critters from existing long enough to fly into our apartment. Our dog knows that if he has to go, that's the place to do it. He knew, instinctively what it was for, probably because it's very similar to grass. Have had it for a couple of months and washed it several times. It's held together very well, and am so happy I spent the money. Game changer for having a dog. No more house accidents. Well once, but he was just trying to get attention."

1,"I liked the plot of the book, but I'm very confused by the ending. It seems as if it's not a standalone book, but that the second is from her friends point of view, but about Stephanie and Denny's relationship. To each their own style, but I find series better if they are all in one point of view, or if they have a happy ending and then move on to other characters stories. I just feel like it's left hanging.

I feel like the dialogue was forced. Some of the things the characters said had me confused. I feel like in some places info was just to be assumed by the reader and not explained. I felt like it jumped around in some places and then in other things were dragged out. Things happened without explaining and I had to reread chapters thinking I missed something.

All in all, it wasn't bad. I love books with babies, I just feel as if I'm left hanging and have no way to fix it."

1,"Barry Raspbody has a unique sense of humor.  Most of the jokes were a bit of a stretch.  There were a few good, although painful, puns.  He also had a few that makes one want to smack either their forehead or his.  They might be easier to understand  and appreciate if they were presented in a comedy routine."

1,Great for the price.  Not for cold weather though.
1,"I saw this movie with my children today and on a scale from 1-10 I give it a ZERO. There is one character who broke out of jail and came back
to get some ""parchment with a magical message""  which he believed he deserved to receive.  In order to get that parchment, he violently tortured, and attempted to kill the man who brought him up and loved him dearly. Never mind that this character is  ten times the size of his mentor. This character will scare small children to death. He is VERY VERY VIOLENT,WITH A DISPLAY OF SUCH ANGER THAT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD BE SEEN BY AN ADULT MUCH LESS A CHILD. SUCH A CHARACTER WOULD BE CONSIDERED  MENTALLY ILL, AND CHILDREN WILL THINK THIS BEHAVIOR IS APPROPRIATE WHEN THEY THINK THEIR PARENTS ARE UNFAIR TO THEM. THINK TEN TIMES BEFORE LETTING YOUR CHILDREN SEE THIS MOVIE."
1,"It's a good message, and the illustrations are really captivating, but the story is very didactic. The message is very clearly ""be yourself"", and it hits you over the head with that. The illustrations are fun to look at. If it weren't for the heavy-handedness of the message it would be a really good book.

The story is reminiscent of Woody Allen's Zelig. There's a girl who really likes lima beans, but nobody else likes lima beans so she always lies and says she doesn't because she's super worried about what everybody thinks of her. Because of that, she starts changing colors based on what other people want her to be. This expands to changing shape, and then becoming even more surreally assimilated into all the furniture and decorations in her bedroom. At the very end, a little old woman says, ""I bet you want some lima beans,"" and the girl says, ""No! Nobody likes lima beans! Wait, never mind I like lima beans!"" And then she eats the lima beans and everything is fixed. Ugh. The message is so obtrusive.

He even had fun pretending that he was looking for Big Foot. The handles are very easy to hold, and the periscope is light weight making it easy to bring on a nature walk or hike. My 3 year old even had a blast playing with it. The periscope can be used inside as well to peek behind couches and ""spy"" on siblings or parents. That makes it a great toy for sunny AND rainy days! The light makes it fun to explore at night too so this would be a great toy to bring on a camping trip! This periscope is also durable which is a must when being used by little ones! I received the periscope from Educational Insights at no charge in exchange for my completely honest review."

1,"The Streamlight SL-20L is --by far-- the best flashlight on the market for law enforcement today. It is exceptionally bright and rugged, and lighter than the older SL-series lights. I've been in police work for more than 15 years, and while I have several very bright (and expensive) small lights (SureFire, Streamlight, others) that I keep on my belt as a backup, the SL-20L is my first choice for illumination. It is brighter than any of the small lights, and significantly brighter than the older SL-20 incandescent torches. I've had this on the road for more than a month now, and it works flawlessly.

Pros:
Pretty comfortable, sturdy, back support, insulated container to place beverages into on the arm, many easy to access pouches, comes with carrying case, price, size (fits in trunk yet still large enough to enjoy)

Cons:
Couple of loose strands (see picture), head part supports up to shoulders (does not support with the semicircle part of the back), extremely wrinkled, number of pockets seems to be a bit much

I love this chair and will be using it tons in the future with my camping trips. If you are considering a chair which will support and last a long time, this can be the portable chair for you. If you are looking for something practical, I would say the same thing, you wouldn't be disappointed. If you are looking for something stylish and clean cut, this may not be you. The amount of places to store things tends to be a bit much for the display aspect. Overall, this is a solid chair."

My daughter was very excited to get this for her birthday and she plays with it all the time.  We have played with it at least once a week for about a week.

I need to order these regularly b/c I pay too much for them at the local dog store."

The movie takes place in the future in a large city, and the characters are human. The movie also has a lot of nudity, and most of the nudity is made on the female side. The movie is quite graphic and I found myself thinking that the sex scenes were a bit graphic, but that it was done to be a bit more sexual."

The author does a great job of explaining how to do it, but the end result was a very difficult task. I was annoyed with the ending, as it made it seem as if the author was trying to drive the reader to get through the book, but he does a great job of explaining why it was a difficult task. As a writer, I was disappointed with the ending. It did not go as planned, and the ending was not at all what I expected."

The zip on lunch bag is a great idea for those of us who look like Hannibal crossing the Alps when we go to work. The lunch bag is big enough for a cold pack and my modest lunch. It might make the load ungainly if you overload the lunch bag.

Not a lot of bells and whistles here otherwise; there is a side pocket for a water bottle. This pack is a little small for day to day commuting for me but will get a lot of weekend use. I think it would be perfect for older school kids and simplify their morning routine. The colors of my pack are significantly different than the photo of the dot pattern."

1,"Our house came with an older Moen tub faucet that had been well-used. I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up. The handle came with a plastic adapter to attach it to the original cartridge, since the plastic knob has a horizontal screw holding it on, while this metal handle uses a vertical set-screw.
It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection. About an inch of the stop tube is exposed now, which doesn't look quite right, but again, I think it's due to our setup. I don't want to tear out the tub surround and replumb entire thing. If you're replacing a knob with this kit, just be aware it may not look quite as good as a new faucet. However, the price difference is substantial."

I would totally recommend this.

Pro's:
1. Sturdy, should fit or be able to make it fit any toilet.
2. There are great forums for this product for any help and tips.

Cons:
1. The design could be slightly better.
  -If your cat may occasionally pee between the white part and the colored insert. The urine will drip into the toilet. I personally carry the entire thing through the house to go outside and spray it clean with the hose. I have to put something under it to catch the droplets.

1,"While struggling to find an adjective to describe this book - the word that sprang to mind was 'childish'.
It reads like the author read a book entitled 'How to write a novel' - then tried to cram all the 'hints' into this book.
The plot is (basically) OK - but the telling of the tale is infantile.
The reader could constantly feel that the author was 'talking down' to them.
Many of the scenarios and occurrences are truly laughable (laugh-out-aloud laughable) in their improbability.....
Then there's the annoying - and silly - open-ended 'ending' ---- leaving the entire rationale of the tome unexplained."

I liked Brandon and his boldness at dinner and that really had me cracking up. I was pissed about the lie he told at his office but I guess he was doing what he thought was best. Eliana seemed like a very sweet person and I hate how what she thought was something special was built from lies. Chelle and Meachy had me so confused but once I started understanding what was what it really threw me for a loop. Meachy's role wasn't excused but she didn't have to let everybody else's secrets out to save her own ass. I'll admit I had a wtf look once Chelle found out Brielle's secret because I was thinking how in the world can she be mad when she's no better. Monique was bitter and wanted her cake and eat it too. Her response to KJ let me know she didn't have it all. Once the secrets started flowing it was like they'd never end. So much trust was broken but the very secrets that destroyed so much also had some good to come about. As always great job Toni and I can't wait to see what you come out with next."

If installing these bulbs into existing, voltage-controlled halogen system(s), note that these bulbs are not electronically voltage controlling, like traditional style light bulb replacement LED bulbs.  These are simply LEDs soldered to a circuit board that passes current through it, allowing all LEDs to receive power.  Halogen systems draw too much power for these led bulbs, causing an LED ""misfire"", where pulse pattern locks into low light mode, which is very dim.  These discs are designed to be used in systems where the voltage is easily controlled and regulated, such as 12V DC.

1,"These are great patches they wipe well and pretty much fit any caliber.  I use them on my AR.  However... DO NOT pinch too much fabric into the ring as it WILL get stuck in your barrel. This happened to me (twice ) I embarrassingly admit.  First timer I took to a gun smith and he poked it out with a rifle rod.  The 2nd I just stepped on the otis cord and PULLED my heart out.

They say you can use each cloth 6 times but if you have a dirty barrel it's more like 3-4... the inserts get opened up and lose integrity and it makes it easy for the patch to break and again... get stuck (happened as well) but I used a rifle rod to push it out.

I've since become a master of these patches and have used over 65....  meaning I've done about 3 times the swipes or like 200 swipes through my rifles.

I recommend the smaller 2 inch patches as they are less likely to get stuck but these are still great.  I always pinch close to the inserts and never use a flimsy patch. I always give it a nice tug to make sure it won't fall off.  I also always check how big it clumps up at the base.  It should feel like a tiny pebble or whatever. Mind you the bullet that goes through the barrel has a small diameter."

1,"We had this gun for more than a month now. We purchased NERF guns in the past and the automatic feature sounds very appealing and fun. Right out of the box (after inserting new C-batteries which were purchased separately), the first time the new darts were placed in the transparent clip, one of the darts clogged the gun. There are times when my son can shoot the entire contents of the clip (18 elite darts - we ended up buying additional elite darts from Amazon - I believe this is a good deal:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nerf-N-Strike-Elite-Dart-Refill-Pack-30-Darts/dp/B0083TXZVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nerf N-Strike Elite Dart Refill Pack (30 Darts)</a>), and other times when the gun gets clogged. It became a habit to watch my son excited to use this gun, only to have it get clogged, and get him upset. I would say the major fault with this gun is clogging: about 30-40% of the time. That's way too much, and I believe the reason for it is the design of the flexible darts. In addition, I would say the use of C batteries may not be the most inspired option. You have to unscrew the battery holder, and I believe that the batteries can drain unnecessary fast, since there is no shut-off button. Otherwise I do not know how to explain why we had to replace batteries 2 weeks after relatively limited playtime.

I was undecided to give this product 3 or 4 stars. I settled on 4 since the gun itself is great fun when it works. I find the issue to be with the flexibility of the darts. Once they get bent, the chances for clogging increases, and even new darts can get stuck and stop the fun."

1,"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole). Lose a significantly cheaper one than this."

The lock is a total failure. The iPhone has to have the app open or it doesn't work, the lock locks arbitrarily, often after I use the key to get in and it locks as I'm closing it (sending the bolt into the doorframe)

1,"I bought two of the Sugar Puppy Surprises, one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and one for my 6 year old niece, for Christmas and they love them and haven't put them down! I had one as a kid and was thrilled when I saw they were remaking these and kept the look of the ones from 20 years ago instead of revamping the look like they do with all the remake toys. Sugar has very soft fur and I love the sparkly strands throughout her purple hair. The stitching on the dog is very well done and it seems durable.

Both of mine had 5 puppies so we were excited about that. Each puppy has a hard vinyl head with a soft body and a pink or blue bow around it's neck to determine if its a girl or boy. The puppies are about 4"" long and Sugar is about 15"" long. My niece's actually had a preemie puppy which was really cool! She was excited that there was a runt in the litter that was slightly smaller than the rest. I do wish the stomach hole in Sugar was a little deeper to accommodate all the puppies a little better but they do fit back in though it's a tight fit. They are very expensive on here and can be found cheaper at Target or Toys R Us. Simple but very fun toy and hands down their favorite gift this year!"

1,"When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love. The characters are well-developed and likeable, the kind of people that you absolutely want to hang out with. Paula Altenburg has written a book that drew me in and kept me reading, and I look forward to reading more from her."

1,"I picked these up on a half price sale a few weeks back.  While I generally don't like to purchase shoes online since each manufacturer tends to fit differently.  Since I have owned Rockport shoes before I gave it a shot.  The shoes are nice looking, comfortable and a good value.
I have been happy with the past Rockports that I have owned and expect no less from these.  The sole is a ridged design so it holds the ground and doesn't slip when walking as has happened with other rubber soled shoes I have owned.
Comfort is the word that is synonymous with the Rockport brand and these shoes are no exception.  They are nice to slip into and nicer to walk in.  The rubber sole has enough give to absorb some of the shock of walking but not enough to feel cheap or soft.
I have a wide foot and normally wear a 10.5.  I fit into an 11 in the Rockports so I suggest going up a half size.
Overall, I would highly recommend these shoes."

1,"I was cleaning out some boxes of children's books, keeping what I consider classic while giving the rest to my grandchildren or to the libraries. I doubled-back between this current edition and the previous editions to make sure this was the same one...it is, and I highly recommend this. I took a class in children's literature back in the 70's and I fondly remember it as being one of the most enjoyable classes I had in college the first time around. This book lasted through my children's growing up and is now going through new useage with my grandchildren. I love the way this book is organized. If you have a child with specific interests such as limericks (and I know few children who don't get a kick out of limericks) you can go to that section without delay.
I grew up with Joan Walsh Anglund poignant drawings. They are not particularly 'great' art, but for children and in this book, they are vastly more suitable than the poorly drawn and maddening stuff put out in cartoons (especially of the Pokemon variety which will set off seizures in children). They say the age of this book is for four years to eight year olds. That isn't true. Every parent should try to take the time to read to all children in whatever form necessary...and it should start at age one. Reading aloud (or signing books) to your children not only makes essential bonds, but it also teaches children what you think is important, and also teaches them how to stop and pay attention. The massive complaints about restless children and the abuse of labeling (ADD/ADHD) has its beginnings in simple things such as turning the television/computers off and reading to your children.
... should be showing the pictures and pages of this book in a sampling, so that parents can make informed decisions about children's books. If you only get one child's book this year, get this one and sit down with your children and read.

1,"I, recently, bought this unit, for a friend.  Upon installation, I found it to have a crystal clear picture, but here is the drawback.

In order to hear ANY sound at all, the box had to be placed on MAXIMUM volume, AND I had to set my stereo on ""acid rock concert"" volume level, to hear ANY sound, at all.  In short, to hear any volume, at all, I had to set the volume so loud that, for any other device, I would have had noise complaints, from my neighbors.

AVOID this product, if you are serious about enjoying t.v..

Its just NOT worth the headache."

This is a great toy for your dog. The little balls are really nice and easy to tear up. There is a small piece of plastic that holds the toy in place and can be easily removed. The only downside is that the plastic is not easy to get out of the toy.

I like that it has a remote control for voice commands. It's not bulky but I really like that it has a built-in camera. I've found that it is really easy to operate it and not have to worry about it falling off the dashboard. I love that it has a USB charging port for my phone and tablet.

1,"This is your typical cheap, made-in-China-esque product. That's fine, but it wasn't .99 - it was what, $6? I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!

All in all, not worth the money. It's a good idea, just poorly made."

0,"I installed this switch in a standard garage door opener. I chose this one because I was just starting to get into the garage. The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on. The light switch is made of plastic, and the light switch does not come with a case. The light switch has a rubber band that allows it to be removed from the door by removing the plastic band. The light switch is on a low voltage circuit that runs from the battery to the switch. The light switch is a single button on the side of the door, and the switch is made of plastic. The switch is placed in a neutral position so that the light switch will be dimmed when the door is in a closed position. The switch is made of plastic, and the switch is made of plastic.

I had to replace the filter with the H-20 filter, which is much more expensive than the H-20 filter. The H-20 filter is still the best choice for me. The H-20 filter is the only way to clean the water without leaving a negative smell. This filter has a nice filter that is clean and easy to clean. I have not had to clean the water yet, but I will be adding a new filter soon. I highly recommend this filter. I have a 60lb dog and he loves this toy. It is very soft and he loves to chew on it. It is the only toy I have ever bought for him that he can't destroy."
1,"OK.  There are multiple, varying reviews on these boots.  Some people say that they are a little big, some say they're ridiculously big... IF YOU OWN ANY OTHER TIMBERLAND SHOES OR BOOTS, JUST ORDER ONE FULL SIZE SMALLER THAN THOSE.

The confusion is that Timberlands (in every other case) run big and require you to wear a half size smaller than normal.  Therefore, if you don't own any Timberlands, order these ONE AND A HALF sizes smaller than your normal shoe size.  Period.  I usually wear a 12.  In Timberlands I wear an 11.5 and in these I needed a 10.5 (yes, this is all ridiculous and I actually can't believe I'm writing all of this right now).

Summary:
Timberlands in general - minus a half your normal size.
THESE Timberlands - minus one and a half your normal size.

These boots are awesome, light, not clunky, soft feeling footbed, nice arch support, look great and I really like them. 4 stars instead of five for the ridiculously stupid sizing and forcing me to get involved.  But it was aggravating to have to return the 11's which I bought based on some other completely unthorough reviews."

1,"Came in the mail really fast! 2 days time. Very good quality made ring. The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

God bless you all & may peace be upon you! I humbly ask for your prayers as I'm entering into Holy Matrimony here in 3 more days for a peaceful marriage, life longevity & happiness

The reason I gave it only 4 Stars was due to the fact the brushed Tungsten is darker than the picture shows & the half size differ that I & many others are talking about"

1,"This skirt runs small. it is listed as a size large and by the sizing chart it is suppose to fit someone size 12-14. well im a small 14 and it is far from fitting me. it barely went over my hips and i was scared it was going to tear. I was hoping to wear this for a wedding this weekend but thats not going to happen. I would say the sizing is more of a size 10. There were no labels on this except one on the inside that had a 5 on it. nothing else. no care instructions or anything. I am on a weight loss journey so im going to keep it and make it my goal to get to. The inner material reminds me of slip material and it was clingy but that also might be because of the sizing..but it did seem to have quite a bit of static. The outer layer is a very thin see-through material. it is where the design in printed and it is very beautiful. the inner layer is about a foot shorter than the outer layer. The belt tie is my favorite part. It has beads and is made with real feathers. You can feel the stem in the fabric of the belt. over all if this skirt fit I would love it but until it does i just like it.

1,"I used to have one that i bought at the big orange boxed store down the street. It worked ok, sometimes too well. It would pull interference seemingly whenever it felt like it. Ripped it out and installed this one, in the master bedroom.

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it."

1,"I read the first two books quite some time ago and really enjoyed them. The third has been on my TBR list ever since. I'm glad I finally got to read it and finish Sebastian and Talia's story. The series was action packed with a fair amount of steamy sex. The mystery behind  Sebastian and Talia's past slowly unravels and there is danger at every corner. The couple find themselves in an on again/off again relationship but the feeling remain. Once again, Sebastian comes to Talia's rescue and they finally begin to start trusting each other and secrets are finally out in the open. All this happens while yet there is another threat against Talia's life. The series was fast paced and has a HEA."
1,"I love scarves. Let's just start with that. So I have LOTS of scarves, plenty to compare to.
This is a very nice scarf, and I'm really glad that I got the chance to try it out.
Obviously, it is an animal print, leopard, to be exact, and the colors ebb and flow into each other, the spots varying in size, and shade, mimicking the leopard's markings, and doing a pretty good job of it, at that.
The background is tan / light brown, and the spots are dark brown and medium brown, and vary in both size and color...like a leopard's spots...go figure!
The fabric is a light chiffon, a polyester that feels like a delicate silk, really very nice.
The edges are hemmed, rather than rolled. To me, that usually means a higher quality than a simple rolled edge. There are exceptions to every rule, I know I am generalizing. Either way, this hem, while not perfect, is done fairly well. I don't see any missed stitches or big puckers, and the approximately 1/8"" hem is even all around.
The light weight of the material allows even a small breeze to move it, making for a nice look and flow.
It is a versatile piece that looks great with classic neutrals and some colors. I think it looks best with tans, browns, blacks, and ivory...but off whites, yellows, oranges would look great too.
It is versatile enough to wear with jeans and a simple blouse, but can be dressy enough to use with evening wear.
Even if you are not a huge fan of animal prints, you would still get plenty of use out of this scarf.
I was fortunate enough to receive this scarf at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

Another problem with the IE6 is that they're too loud (115db/V), meaning you'd need an extra volume control if you plug it into an airplane audio socket. The Sony EX36V already has a volume control built-in, and isolates outside noise better than the IE6. Still not the same sound fidelity as the PXC450, but not bad for less than $30.

1,"Like other Planet Dog toys, this ball is good, but not the best.  The knot in the rope comes undone quickly, so you will have to tie it again.  Also, if you have a constant chewer/mouther on balls (and don't just use it for fetching), the outer shell of the ball can come apart off of the inner shell that has the continents on it.  But that is usually after lots and lots of chewing.  Other than that, my dogs LOVE these balls.  They love the softness and the chewability."
1,"I absolutely love this Black Dome Tungsten Ring.  I wanted to get my hubby a wedding band that is different and unique.  I fell in love with this one, it is solid black and polished.  This ring looks so good and is made very well.

I got a size 9 which fits my hubby perfectly.  I have a ring sizer at home and this ring was sized exactly.  The ring is heavy for a normal ring, but that is expected from a tungsten ring.  He says it fits and rests comfortable on his finger.

Tungsten is a very hard and dense metal.  From the research that I have found, tungsten is ten times harder than 18k gold and four times harder than titanium and twice as hard as steel.  This ring is very durable and will last the test of time.  It has a nice polish and since he has been wearing it, the polish has held up really nicely.  He does a lot of hard labor and nothing has scratched it.

I completely recommend this ring.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This review is a 100% my own  opinion and I was not compensated in any way."

0,"'Say Die Strom (is that what it is?).  The film is a turn-off for the young (and the old) people, and the social class.  It is very much like a family movie, with a good script, good acting, and a good story.

""Die Strom"" is a great family movie, and I hope it continues to be like this.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I have a hard time finding anything that could have been better.

If you like family, you will love this movie!  It is a movie that is well-made, well-acted, and well-written.  The only thing that is missing is a good dose of humor.  This movie is not for everyone, and it should be avoided at all costs.

A good review is provided in the DVD section.  You can view the entire movie in its entirety.

To conclude, this is a great family movie.  The acting, the story, and the direction are excellent.  The movie is a must-see, and it will be enjoyed by any family.  I recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I don't care for the negative reviews.  I love family movies!I love this series, the costumes, the music, and the story.  This is an excellent collection.

Often, a model will return briefly in a limited edition ""sprint run"", and those generally sell out quickly because of a wide collector base.

This model is small, tough, and insanely sharp. At this price, if you've considered collecting, this one is a good start. Legendary quality on a knife that may or may not be around for long."

I have a portable light that I can use for a walk or bike ride. I just put it on my car and it works great. I have two of these on my phone. I've used the light for a couple of months now and it's just fine. I've found that it is really bright and it's very useful. It's not a full size light, but it's nice to have something that's more light than I've had before. I also like that the battery is made of metal and I can recharge it quickly. I recommend this light to anyone who is looking for a rechargeable flashlight. I've had mine for a couple of months now and it's very bright. I've seen some reviews that said it would be more expensive than a standard compact flashlight. But it's not. I don't have any flashlights that cost more than this one, so it's not a great deal for a small flashlight. But if you're looking for a cheap compact flashlight that you can recharge quickly, this is a great buy. The quality is good and the light is good quality. It's heavy and I like that it's bright."

I was hoping by buying in bulk I would be saving money but it was a waste. First off the lid always takes the whole end of the dauber off so it's an explosion of ink waiting to happen. After you unscrew the lid you have to take the lid and push down on the ink pad to get it to click back in. Also the colors are more like paint so lavander  you can't even see the numbers behind. These things are crappy. I've ended up with a stained shirt from ink exploding and numerous ones I can't even use!

If anything, the section on how the collapse of WTC1 and WTC2 was made more clear with the explanations supplied with the excerpted footage from Explosive Evidence than Explosive Evidence itself.

Where this documentary fell down was in the omission of Silverstein's PBS interview where he freely admitted that WTC7 was deliberately imploded, which was one of the few actual pieces of evidence given in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/9-11-The-Myth-and-The-Reality-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000VRF4C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">9/11: The Myth and The Reality - 2 DVD Set</a>.  The other glaring issue was the allegation that pulmonary fibrosis and mesothelioma were running rampant in the wake of the destruction of WTC1 and WTC2.  Problem:  asbestos-induced interstitial fibrosis and mesothelioma have very clear latency times of 20 years after the date of first exposure.  If such an epidemic is to happen, it will not happen for another 45 months from the time this review is written.  Also, mesothelioma already occurs in 1/1,000,000 people each year WITHOUT prior asbestos exposure.  If these diagnoses in past cases are correct, there are some equally disturbing causes: either a) there was prior exposure well ahead of 9/11, or b) there are additional toxic materials not previously identified to the public used in the construction of WTC1 and WTC2."

The only thing I didn't like is that the light is very warm and doesn't stay on for long.  I'll have to order another one.  I hope they last a long time.We have had this item for over a year and have only had it for a few days.  It's very easy to install and the light is very bright.  I haven't had to rewire it yet, but it's definitely a good value.  I can't say enough about the quality of the product.  I'm using it for my daughter's room.  I've had it for a few months now and the light is great.  I haven't had any issues with it.I really like these. They are great for taking a shower. They are very bright and they are very small. They fit my shower head perfectly. I use them for a wide variety of tasks. I have used them for very small jobs, I have had them for a long time and they are very handy. They are a good size for the job I am doing. I would recommend these for a small job.I have been using this light for years and it works great. It is pretty, easy to install and works great.

I could not believe all the additional cat/dog hair that it pulled out of the carpet. My back is not so great but this is easy to handle. This is my first bagless system and I really thought I would hate it but it empties out very easy & goes right back on the system with no problem.

1,"Critics are generally not very nice to movies like this one.  I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).
NOTES:  The sign outside the music store says ""8 Tracks"".  I feel so OLD!!  Speaking of, there are at least 2 terrific songs on the soundtrack, ""Got to believe in Magic"", ""King and Queen of Hearts"", etc.  Worth the price alone."

1,"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!"

While I was disappointed in it breaking so quickly/easily, I was impressed with the ease of returning/exchanging this necklace.  It took a few extra days because of the holiday but I had the new necklace a week later.  Only bummer is that since it was a Christmas gift I had to wait weeks to get it to my niece since they wouldnt allow me to have the necklace shipped to an address other than the original shipping address.  My niece lives an hour and a half from me.  Overall I give this necklace 4 stars because its super cute but I don't expect it to last long due to the quality of the first necklace.  Great buy for the price though."

The ending was better than the rest of the book and almost makes me want to read the second. I didn't really connect with the characters.  I just felt blah about all of it.  I wouldn't really recommend this book.  Its just a hard read.  There isn't too much of a student teacher relationship, well it doesn't feel like that.  Its almost like the author got bored writing this book in some parts too."

1,"This could have been great. Unfortunately the most important feature is useless. The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

This is a 5 star item now that I've ""fixed"" it, but as it was, because it's so very easy to lose, 3 stars."

1,"Product feels heavy duty and well constructed. It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.  Overall, however, I'd much rather have the cable heavy duty and the minor inconvenience of its weight is a good trade off."

Holy crap John Cassian is one dark, twisted amazing author!! When I read his first book Killing Matt Cooper I was a bit unsure at first, but by the end I was floored. After finishing book two I am speechless absolutely speechless. This is an amazing book and Mr. Cassian is a gifted author. I look forward to reading more of his works.

""Evolution was trying to stamp me out because I liked to swim in the black pool of my own darkness.""

An FBI agent in love with the serial killer she is assigned to capture, it's almost laughable but John Cassian makes it believable. We learn so much about the main character in this book and what attracted Kathleen to him ""There was something...pure about you. Something juvenile, but pure and single-minded and real. You seemed like such a normal guy, such a hard-working, misunderstood everyman, but with this...dark underbelly."" This book is full of OMG, WTF,  I did NOT see that coming and NO! moments that I stayed up all night just to finish it. All I can say now is Mr. Cassian HURRY UP and release Killing Miss Underwood!

1,"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between."

The mounts can fit both single screw speakers (like my Sony) and double screw speakers, they can also be set up to be longer (about 5"") or shorter (about 3"") and come with the screws and hardware to mount to the speaker and to the wall (including dry wall anchors)  The mounts also include the Allen wrench necessary to adjust the mounts and permit the speaker to be oriented just about in any direction or attitude.

With the help of my cordless screwdriver, I had both speakers mounted nicely on the wall in about 15 minutes.  (And that includes looking over the included instructions until I realized that one could actually ignore them.)  Now these aren't the most beautiful speaker mounts, and they are plastic so don't try and mount some huge 20-lb speaker.  But for mounting small satellite speakers just about anywhere, these will work just fine, and at about $10 the price is just right."
1,"First off, I think the cover for outlaw is fabulous!  After Reaper's Property, my friend and have been looking for other books about the MC lifestyle.  While Cole is VP of the Outlaws, he is hardly a bad ass biker, but I still loved the character.

Cole is a biker with a conscience, he sees Angel in trouble at another club's party and feels the need to help her.  Poor Angel is just in the wrong place at the wrong time, her situation is bad and she is definitely saved from worse by Cole.

These two spend 9 days together, living, learning and having fun, until the floor drops out from under them.  Cole then has to decide what he wants to do with the rest of his life and Angel has to decide if she even wants Cole in hers anymore.

I think the book was well written and I liked the story line, it was a little slow from the get go, then the drama ensues.  It wasn't a gritty biker romance, but a good romance just the same."

There is a good variety of shapes and sizes, and this 60-piece set is a nice size.  I think if you had a smaller set, it would be difficult to build much, but 60 is enough.  The reason I am giving these four stars instead of five is that these tiles are clearly not as ""sticky"" as MagnaTiles, which are also significantly pricier.  These tiles do not stick together as well because the tiles are thicker, which has the effect of making the magnets seem weaker.  There may be an added safety benefit in that these tiles are more difficult to break, but the extra ""stickiness"" of MagnaTiles is appreciated by my daughter."

1,"I finished Ambassador: Seeing Red, today. I loved this book.

Patty Jansen has done a remarkable world building job, building a complex interplanetary society structured around 'gamra,' with earth and humanity as we mostly know it, sitting on the periphery. Cory Wilson is earth's second ambassador to 'gamra' - but the first ambassador who actually understands the society he's about to be thrust into.

The politics, cultural differences and language differences are complex, but well developed and understandable, and I was easily drawn into the world that she created. At times I felt as hot and bothered and exhausted as Cory, struggling to adapt to the heat of a world far from earth, or as frozen as Thayen, drenched and shivering from experiencing temperatures well below her norm.

The story moved rapidly, and I was drawn in very quickly, and kept tapping the pages of my kindle much longer than I should really have been awake.

I've been reading Science Fiction for a long time. This story is good. It's not simplistic, but neither is it so far out of left field that it has more culture than character. It's a really good tale with enough twists and turns to keep you flicking the pages, and the characters are real and develop from moment to moment. I'm now looking forward to reading the next one. Ambassador 2: Raising Hell."

1,"Romantic suspense is at its very best with this latest read from Ms. Wainscott. Wrapped up in one terrific package is a rampant serial killer, a controlling husband, a beaten-down wife, and a handsome mysterious loner all connected in this intricate and suspenseful plot.
With the reappearance of ""Spooky Silas"" Koole, Katie is reminded of the girl she used to be before she married local vet and her savior, Ben Ferguson. After her mother died, Katie lived with another family and was befriended by Ben who had aided her when Gary, the bully, injured her kitten. Now, after nine years of marriage, Katie is but a shell of her former self, complacent and pleasing, no longer the spirited girl Silas remembered.
Even as Silas warns Katie to trust no one, the serial killer strikes again, leaving no body, and Silas is the main suspect. And fear strikes Katie, as the list of possible suspects cleverly emerges: Is it Gary, the kitten abuser and gruff cop, Harold, the creepy ""art"" dealer, Silas, who empathetically feels the killer, or Ben, the town hero and control freak husband?
As love emerges between loner Silas and a damaged Katie, it becomes so much more than just romance, mainly a culmination of life-long love deepening into mature adult love. As they begin to trust one another, Katie is forced to question her marriage, her mother's death years before, and her life, as she has known it for the last nine years.
Ms. Wainscott's latest is a masterpiece of mystery, chock full of suspense, and brimming with romantic attraction. Readers unfamiliar with this rising star's work will definitely want to check out this latest suspenseful novel."

Erin is good at tennis, but while she likes it, it doesn't mean everything to her, not the way it does to her mom. Erin's mom is determined that Erin use her talent for tennis, and become something really good, but Erin just wants to have a normal life.

One day whilst visiting her grandmother, Erin finds herself sent back in time to 1970, where she has the chance to play tennis against her mother.
Who will win the match? Is Erin better than her mother? And how will Erin get back to her own time?

This was an okay read, but it felt a little awkward in places.

Erin liked tennis, but not as much as her mother did, and more than anything she wanted to be a normal teenager, and go to the movies with her friends when she wanted to. Erin tried to fit in when she realised that she had travelled back in time, but I expected her to be a lot more concerned with how she was getting back than she was. I personally would have been worried about how I was going to get back, and how soon I would be able to get back rather than making friends in 1970 and taking advantage of how cheap the prices were in the shops!

The storyline was okay, but the time-travel aspect felt a little strange. At the beginning of the story we hear from Erin how annoyed she gets with her mum, and how irritating some boy at school is, and then we're suddenly thrown back in time to 1970. Very sudden, and unexpected, and just didn't fit well with the rest of the story.
The ending was okay, and it was good that Erin learned a little about the sort of person her mom really was. I also liked the fact that Erin's actions in 1970 had consequences, and that her meddling in the past changed things in the present.

Overall; an okay time-travel/coming-of-age story.

I am wearing on the last hole so that it is not tight and uncomfortable.  I will most likely go down a notch once a little stretched to my foot.  The heel is the biggest consideration.  While I can wear them the whole day they are not totally comfortable the whole whole day.  The ball of my foot does feel some pressure as there is not a lot of padding or cushion. The heel is on the higher side of a wedge but again looks very attractive.  The material of the shoe is a suede like fabric and flexible, not stiff.  The only other issue I had was some rubbing of my baby toe which is not a defect of the shoe.  I think once warn a few more times and broken in they will be pretty good.

1,"Been running with this watch for awhile now and am very happy with it.  I especially like all the fixes and enhancements that they have put into the watch since I started with it.  I feel like they are really listening and adjusting the watch based on user feedback.

There are a few things that I wish it did differently, however these are small issues and it handles the basic important functions I need (pace, avg pace, distance, heart rate .... etc.) very well.  The main display is easy to read and you can scroll up/down to get other information while you run.  The two smaller displays at the top are a bit small (I had to buy a pair of sunglasses with ""cheaters"" built in - yes, I'm over 40).

It does find the satellites very quickly when you start your run from the same place each time, however does take longer (maybe a minute or more) if you start from someplace else.  This seems to be common among gps watches however."

1,Watched insidious chapter 2 the other night and I enjoyed it. If you liked the first one you will probably enjoy the follow up. The movie picks up pretty much after the events of the first film. And the Lambert family now have their son back and are trying to get back to normal family life. But as the movie goes on they can tell that something is off about Mr. Lambert played by Patrick Wilson. He just is not the same after saving his son from the other side following the events of the first film. Loved how they tied everything together in the sequel and I would definitely watch this again. Check it out.

Only thing is ISP offered 110Mbps and is only using 8x4 - not full 16x4 which I hoped for - load balancing. A 4x4 could do it but my 8x4 6141 gets 200Mbps so I wanted Mom to have the best.

1,"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for.
Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen.
""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe.
Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending.
There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more.
To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film. MGM has produced an excellent DVD with a stunning transfer (including a new 5.1 surround soundtrack) and a solid collection of extras that should please fans of this crime thriller masterpiece."

1,"Great cheap pots. Dishwasher safe (no nasty exterior coating like other pots) Good nonstick interior all the way to the rim. Doesn't chip easily. I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

1,"An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

ONE FUNNY AND GOOD POINT!  When it works, it makes a delicious cup of coffee!"

I love Levet and am so happy for him right now. Ive adored him from the moment he was introduced in the Guardians of Eternity books and I look forward to seeing him in the future books. After what happened in Fear the Darkness , I could not wait to see what happens next for Levet. All the trials, heroism, and persistence in the face of danger has finally paved the way for him to over come his past, put closer on his clan, and get something he has wanted for years.

We are also given a tiny romantic side story, where Levet does his usual match making. It was a sweet story, but I would have loved it to be a novel or a full length of its own.

1,"This is a review for the Disney Princess's: Sparkling Princess Series Collection by Mattel and Disney. Overral this doll is very amazing!  The doll has a golden sparkly crown, (Instead of a bow, we are treated to a nice crown) overall the crown is very satisfying, I really like the extra sparkle in the crown. Snow White's dress is gorgeous as well, the top part is blue with blue sparkles along with a red bow on the end of the top, on the top sleeves we have a puffy part of the sleeve that is baby blue with red color as well added along with it, kinda like a pattern. Next on the bottom part of the dress we are treated with a yellow sparkly color, this part of the dress is probably the most sparkled part of the dress. What I really enjoyed was the cool pictures of apples made out of the yellow sparkles, In Snow White she ate a poisonous apple, which was why this was included in the outfit. But I eventually found out in the Sparkling Princess Mattel Barbie Collection is that they also included different pictures symbolizing parts in the treasured Disney classics in the other dolls as well. The last part of the outfit is the red sparkly shoes, which stay on pretty nicely. Overall I rate the outfit a 5.0. Other than the outfit we have Snow White herself, who in my opinion is one of the prettiest Snow White dolls in the Disney Mattel Doll Collection. She has brown eyes, (Doesn't have much makeup which actually makes her look even more pretty) plain black hair, and pink lips. The only thing that didn't appeal to me was the regular looking skin, which in the story she is described to have ""skin as white as snow"", which her skin isn't pale. Actually I bought the Cinderella Sparkling Princess doll as well and found out her skin was more pale. But overall it doesn't bother me. I rate the whole thing full five."
1,"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction."

Seemed to perform just fine when connected directly to onboard USB ports, but very, very sensitive to being connected via powered USB hubs. With one system (WinXP home with a powered USB hub) it totally took down the USB bus as long as it was plugged in - not good at all.

So - seems OK as long as you're not using a USB hub. But unfortunately it's a pain for me to disconnect something else in order for me to plug directly into an onboard USB port on the one system."
1,"Love this lunch box. We switched to a preschool that does not serve lunch and I was really dreading packing lunch every school day. This box makes it so easy for us to pack and fun for our daughter to eat. It holds plenty for little ones, probably through elementary school, and is great for portion control and for making sure all of the food groups are represented (I am a stickler for putting the correct type of food in each compartment).
We had a problem with one of the hinges from the beginning and I wrote to Yumbox about it and it was replaced at no charge within a week.

1,"After reading every review on deep fryers I could find, I finally decided on this one.  It has been great and I couldn't ask for anything better or more easy to use.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats."

Wanted the antenna for local news/weather and sports.

With that said, I was very skeptical purchasing this contraption...so when it arrived, I was even more nervous as the antenna is literally paper thin with a black and white side!  Anyway, mounted it at the very top of my ceiling to give it every opportunity to succeed (they do give you a nice amount of cable so that you can mount fairly high up) attached end of cable to TV, set to Air, and had the tv do it's air scan and about 2 min later I have over 20+ free channels!  local news, sports, shopping channels, fox, and few others that I'm not really sure what they are...The picture and sound quality is amazing as well...almost as if I had HD cable!

Materials quality and style are superb as well. After reading many reviews, I decided these would offer the best sound quality within my budget of less than $200, and I'm very happy with my purchase! Like other reviewers said, these offer very accurate sound reproduction. They have plenty of tight, punchy bass when it's recorded in the music, but it's not overpowering. If you're looking for exaggerated, skull-rattling bass, these probably aren't the phones for you. I use them to listen to Tidal lossless audio streaming, and the result is a stellar listening experience."

1,"I've had this Lunchbots for over a year now.  Overall, it's been a decent container, though only useful for dry goods.  My original intent was to purchase an 'heirloom' lunchbox that was completely foodsafe -- what better choice for that than stainless steel, right?

So anyway, over a year later, the paint regularly chips off.  Each day, there are some paint flakes to be found everyhwere -- in the tote bag I use to carry this container, on the rim, and if I'm not careful, in my food.

Given the times we live in, and that there's no way for me to know for certain whether there's lead, cadmium, or other toxics in the paint, this will soon go into the trash.

In fact, that's why I'm on Amazon today -- I came shopping for a 100% stainless steel replacement.  After seeing this pop up in the search, I thought I'd at least help others by sharing my experience.

Someone did suggest that Lunchbots was extremely customer-service oriented, and would replace the lids -- no questions asked.  That was not my experience at all.  I wrote to customer service, and got a standard 'stock' response back which suggested the product is no longer under warranty and this was considered normal 'wear and tear' -- but that I could buy some replacement lids (which were also painted) if I wanted to, at my expense.

(apparently this comes with a one year warranty, so that's all the product is guaranteed for)

So much for quality and so much for manufacturer product support.

Seriously -- what's the point of spending some $20 for a stainless steel item if it won't last much longer than a year?

Maybe I am an odd duck, but i wear this on my forearm facing the inside. I like the access to my phone it provides without having to twist and squirm to get it off my bicep when I am running (skipping songs, etc). The sizing seems correct. My forearm is 12"" around and it fits snug but is not constricting. It seems to be very well made with good stitching and a nice, comfortable padding on the back. The fabric wicks moisture as it is supposed to and is very cool feeling. When I am traveling and running, I just slide my room key in there too. It is perfect as far as I am concerned and had exceeded my expectations."

1,"Well, it just came in the mail and I was so excited (my 7 months old adopted dog is a mad chewer, particularly on cords) that I opened it immediately and began to put it on my iPad cord. I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it."

1,"I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash."

My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

1,"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading."

1,"(1.) Anne is attractive and the film is so dependent on it that she and the camera exploit it with constant close ups of her face and her charming/beguiling but theatrically pointless expressions (over 50% of the film actually).
(2.) Plot is a rip off of other crash movies where we are led to believe they're alive but they're not.
(3.) Dialogue is very poorly scripted with cliched non-professional exchanges between roles such as Wilson as the ex-corporate V.P. turns wall painter, motorcycle rider, sailboat sailor, midnight swimmer, rooftop wall sitter (fortunately less than a minute for each activity) with the totally unrealistic and incompetent questioning by Anne the psychiatrist.
(4.) Little effort by the studio to spend money. No realistic special effects and no effort to research plane crashes. The plane's remnants should have been clearly marked and placed in a secure hanger. To save composer and musicians fees the music was a constant and monotonous plunking of a few piano keys. Saved money by not having a director as evidenced by the lack of continuity and building tension appropriate for this type of movie. Well, someone added a gratuitously brief semi-sex scene.
(5.) But the worst crime that the studio commits is to exploit people's fear of flying and death with the feelgood ""you're not really dead just vacationing your dreams forever""."
0,These take up the entire room. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the bottom on top. The plastic part is also hard to put on the sides. I have had this product for about a year now. It is very well made and it holds a lot of things. It is very easy to store and I can use it on my counter top. I will say that I have to be careful with it as it is very fragile.
1,"I have 2 daughters and found this book while searching for a new story about sisters.  The reviews were so good, and the pictures I could see so sweet that I ordered it.  When it arrived I read it to myself and indeed my eyes did smart towards the end.  But instead of thinking about my daughters I found myself thinking of myself and my 2 older sisters.  I related perfectly to the conflicting feelings of the little sister, and to the conclusion in which love for her big sister won out, but she still kept her afternoon alone to herself, something that's hers alone.  I adore the illustrations and feel the story is perfectly told for about 3-7 year olds - just enough repetition for new readers, too.  I'm impressed with the way it addresses the topic of conflict between sisters, without making anyone the bad guy, or without being obnoxious or shallow.  My daughters are still a little too young for this book but I expect it will become a classic in our family.  My highest compliments to this author."

1,"This is definitely my kind of book. It has everything that makes a really good thriller/adventure/military read. I loved the added mythology angle that was backed up by real sites. The science angle was believable and a the human experimentation added to the spine tingling parts. The action starts with the first page and you hardly have time to breath between pages. Robinson takes the reader on a rocket ride of adventure, treachery, treason and death. Each of his characters has special talents. Melding them into a fighting team is King's (Jack) job. In this story you get a lot of background about each team member. How and why the ""Chess Team"" was formed. Why Jack chose each name. Where Stan got his Desert Eagles. The first time Jack and Zelda met and what happened. How he won her respect and the rest of the teams. The bonds they formed with each other to become the fighting unit they are. Their first mission is to rescue a scientist who can translate an ancient manuscript. She has been kidnapped by unknown persons. The Chess Team follows the bad guys from Afghanistan to Iran and finally to France. They fight the Chinese tong, mutated humans, and unspeakable horrors. Finally in France they face the end of all life and maybe, the end of the planet. This is my first book by Robinson but not my last. I have already got his other Chess Team books on my ""to get"" list. I wish they were all audio books narrated by Jeffery Kafer. He has a very pleasing voice and gives life to the characters. He gets the dialogue between the team just perfect. Sometimes too perfect. LOL. The production of the audio was perfect. No static, dead spots, or skips. Everything was professional and well recorded. If you have read any of Jeremy Robinson Chess Team books you HAVE to read this one. The start of it all. Audiobook provided for review by the narrator.

1,"The premise of this story, an attractive successful adult ""aged"" single female going after a feloniously enslaved compounded with new baby high school male encounter is preposterous.  Even admits to her parents that she has an All Co Hell problem.  Major impetus was the terminal nature of her original successes writing ""young adult"" (i.e. teeny bopper) novels, which in All Co Hell impaired *teeny bopper* fashion she treats as the end of the world.  ""I think you should leave"" is what she got from her target after having been invited to a baby naming party at the direction of the target's *wife*.  The whole story reminded me of the recent 2015 Jana Kramer C&W song ""I Got the Boy, She Got the Man"".  Too much involved in her own high school level fictional writings to complete evolving her own adult personality.  Well enough acted, photographed, and produced to maintain a three star rating."

1,"I am a young teen who recently read this book and I personal believe that  this book is pretty innocent compared to the ""The Big Nate"" series. It Has intelligent humor unlike the big Nate series too. there is not a lot of disrespectfulness of other people in this book and it dosen't have bad messages unlike big Nate. The reason I am comparing it to big Nate series is because I am aware that both books are very popular and funny, but I have read big Nate, and i would agree that it has a very bad message, with unintelligent humor, and many inappropriate scenes. I would prefer children reading diary of a wimpy kid more so then the school drop-out who likes to skip school big Nate. In diary of a wimpy kid the main character is not a school drop-out But does talk a little bit about girls, but not a lot. Diary of a wimpy kid deals with some problems that people may face in real life in the dramatic middle school, like problems with friends, bullying, and looking ""cool"",  but the author took these problems and added some funny spice to them to make it a Funny novel that children can laugh at and say, ""I know exactly how he feels, but how did he deal with it? I think i am going to read on to find out."" this book is a great and funny series that is overall innocent and deserves only the best. It makes children want to read the addicting book. It takes problems people face everyday and turns them into a laughable story. I would suggest this book to all ages."

1,"""Laurel Canyon"" is an entrancing languid film about the intersection of individuals and lifestyles.
Briefly, the film covers the relationship between a young professional couple who have been studying at Harvard played by (Sam) Christian Bale and (Alex) Kate Beckinsale and the lifestyle of Sam's record producer mother Jane (Frances Mc Dormand) and her younger boyfriend Ian (Allesandro Nivola).  The Harvard culture is conservative and polite whereas Jane's Los Angeles culture is uninhibited and hedonistic.  Sam is embarrassed by his mother while Alex is slowly drawn in like a moth to a flame.
The couple comes to within a hair's breadth of falling apart but it is Sam who first recognises problems and temptations when he resists an attractive work colleague Sara played by Natasha Mc Elhone.  He then confronts his partner who steps back from the edge of a moral abyss.  Sense is ultimately seen by all and the two lifestyles choose to recognise and respect their differences.
The plot is virtually non-existent.  Rather, the film is a study of the simmering tensions between two very different ways of life.  It is this tension that sustains the film."

0,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters. The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them. This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget. This is a great book."

1,"I have to say it's been years since I have felt so engaged reading a book.  Oddly, I saw the movie before buying the Kindle book; and in the middle of reading, I decided to watch the movie again.  I suspect it won't be long and I will read the book once again.

This is a thinking person's book and story, and thus isn't for everyone.  But the mastery of the writing is so highly evocative that you ""see"" the book as you read it.  Incredibly deep characters, mesmerizing continuity of theme (which some might argue about, given that the book is written as segments contributing to a ""writ large"" story), the ability to make you laugh, cry and inevitably sigh, ""yes.""

I had never heard of David Mitchell before reading this book.  But it only took me 500+ pages to realize what an important writer and artistic voice he is.

I am a strong supporter of public libraries, and have downloaded Kindle versions of books to determine if I will actually buy the book.  In the case of Cloud Atlas, it was a no-brainer.  I finished Cloud Atlas today and immediately downloaded ""Ghostwritten"" from my local library.  I suspect it won't be long and my Kindle cloud will have all of his works in it.

If you think and therefore read, and read to think, Cloud Atlas will keep your mind whirling.  It's a must-read piece of literature. It's a truly gripping story."

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the Third World War, when the British and French were fighting in a war against one another.  The two main characters, Maisie and Marguerite, are young and inexperienced soldiers who are sent to China in search of a place to live and to train for war.  They are assigned to a small town in the middle of nowhere, where the Germans have developed a reputation for being violent, and where the French have been particularly successful.  The village is ruled by a group of young French women who live in a small apartment, and the Germans are at the"

1,"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag."
1,"My cats loved this product. I used Instinct food for them prior to starting to make my own food two years ago. Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions. They have consumed the treats on an off for for over a year. No idea if something in the product changed, or if my furchildren grew resistant to the product's ingredients. If you use this product, Keep a close watch on your kittie's chin!!"

I highly recommend it. I had to read this book to get through the first two chapters. I felt like I was reading a story about an old woman who had her own problems. I felt like the author had developed a very detailed and convincing case for the life of a woman who had her own problems. The book is very well written and takes a lot of time to get through. I would recommend it for those who like a story that focuses on a woman who has had a life of her own. This was a great book."
1,"Intensity is very special book, since its story is so different than any other and so damn unpredictable!

Every twist and every turn the story takes is unexpected and brilliantly developed. The characters take us in one spectacular ride and we love every second of it!

I couldn't put it down!!

Serena is such a lovely character! She has a good heart, but she isn't naive or crying her heart out over men. She is a good and loyal friend. She isn't fearless; she has fears that she deal with every single day. She is a good girl, but isn't judgemental regarding others who arent.

Linc is well..a good man / alpha male. He has this Youre mine - No one touches you thing, but he isn't overbearing. He protects with elegance, should I say. Hes quite the gentleman for an alpha male, too.

I have to say that everyone should have one Serena as a friend and definitely a Linc as a man!

Its beautifully written and everything fits perfectly!!

Intensity is a great book and I loved it!

I strongly recommend it!!

However, I would like to say that its the FIRST BOOK!! The story continues to the next book or books.

Personally, I strongly dislike when I don't know this fact before I read the book. I don't have an issue if its a 2 book story or a trilogy. But I do want to know beforehand. Unfortunately, it does not happen.

In conclusion, Intensity is a great book that you MUST READ!!

So, Intensity receives 5 Huge Sparkling Golden Stars!!"
1,"I could not put this book down.  Quick paced, intriguing and exciting.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book!"
1,"I ordered this tea set last week, after reading many reviews and contacting Green Toys. I asked the company about the leaky teapot problem which was mentioned in several lower-star reviews. A company representative responded, assuring me that the design of the teapot had been changed to fix the leak problem.
It is evident that the leak problem has been fixed; it no longer has a seam around the middle of the teapot that was causing the leak problem. It should be noted that the lids of the teapot and sugar bowl are no longer interchangeable; the teapot lid is much bigger than the sugar bowl.

I love that the set is cute, made in the USA, dishwasher-safe, able to hold liquid, and came in awesome packaging (even though that only matters when you first get it, it's so nice to have the frustration-free packaging! Why can't every company package items this way?)

I originally gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because:
  The tea set seemed smaller than I thought it would be (but it's actually just right for my 2-year-old, so I actually wouldn't want it any bigger)
  The green plates are  a lime green instead of the soft pastel pictured
  The teapot lid isn't as pictured (but is now leak-free!) and isn't interchangeable with the sugar bowl lid
  While the set appears durable, there are some small flaws that appear to have occurred in the manufacturing process. My daughter tripped and fell on the sidewalk while carrying a teacup and the plastic is scraping off a little bit from where it hit the ground.
  You may need to have your toddler hold the lid while pouring. It stays on with careful, gentle use, but also falls off sometimes.
  It could be priced a little lower (say $15-$18 instead of $20).

Bottom line: Definitely worth getting, not quite perfect. I would still buy this tea set and am happy with the purchase."

1,"I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand."
1,"I would give this book all the stars possible on any rating system. I didn't think anyone could write memoir as well as Jo Ann Beard. I found that writer in Mary Karr. If you're a writer, read this book because Ms. Karr knows how to write WELL (unlike all the other crapola that's lying on bookshelves for some unknown, mysterious reason). If you're not a writer read this book for the same reason. She is incredibly talented - SYU is very lucky to have her on their staff. I could sit and read this book over and over and over again. Some of the stuff is not pleasant, so if certain sexual acts offend you, skip that part (near the end) and move one. Get this book. Now."

I had considered buying a roll of automobile tint as it's cheaper but decided against it due to the worry it wouldn't cling as well as these and some tints have adhesive on them which would be a no-go for the intended purpose of using on electronics devices.

The item works well and the cling is good and fairly stable. It won't cling to everything though so keep that in mind and instead use a small piece of electrical or duct tape if you need to. I use this mainly for some electronics devices connected to my bedroom TV but also for my large blue LED alarm clock and it works great. I have only had to readjust it once or twice in 6 months."

1,"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began."

I had to try on a few different sizes, but ended up settling for a half-size down from what I usually wear. When you try them on, keep in mind that they're going to be almost uncomfortably tight. Give it time. I wore mine for a full day, then when I put them on the second day, they stretched enough so they slipped on my feet, and they're perfect.

1,"This was a pain to assemble (you need strong thumbs to force the clips onto the wires), but so very worth it!  A friend bought me this as a gift, and the shelves are so much bigger than the other pen I have that full-sized cat beds fit easily on them.  In fact, it's assembled in my living room and operating as the ultimate cat tree.  I have a cat bed on each shelf and 2 in the bottom, and the cats spend a good chunk of time in there voluntarily.  I'm thinking of attaching a couple of dangling cat toys to the top so that they can play in there as well, but it's turned out to be their favorite napping place other than next to the human on the lounge.  I have 7 cats and would seriously consider getting a 2nd one, so that they can all nap in one when I'm not here to curl up next to.  Also considering putting litterboxes in the bottom of one... may just encourage use.

Clips were changed between original instructions and shipping, there were updated instructions in the bag with the clips, they weren't hard to understand, but took some serious torque with my thumbs to get them clicked into place.  And, while they work fine on the sides, for attaching the top they seem a bit iffy.  I am using nylon slip ties to help tighten that up since I have cats who like to scale the outside of it and sit on top -- I may even put a pet bed up there and tie it in place for my 2 serious climbers.

Would I recommend this cage?  Yes, I may even buy another one for ""cat tree"" use myself if they bring the white one back into stock -- cages in the livingroom are not exactly ""high design"" -- I'd like them to at least match."

It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light.

Deadline has small-town official corruption on a grand scale and on a parallel plot track, dog-napping on a grand scale. Lots of interesting characters and of course, Virgil Flowers solving both crimes in his own style of brilliant sleuthing, folksy investigation and his endless fascination with fishing Minnesota lakes and rivers with just enough romance to give him a very human quality. All in all, a fun read written as only John Sandford can."

It's not really flattering, it's a little frumpy looking in my opinion. That is the reason for only 3 stars. Functionally, however, it works well.

There are good architecture books, by, for example, Lindsey Davis (a Roman villa in Britain) and Ellis Peters (a great cathedral). This isn't one of them."
0,"So where do I start?

First off, I need to make sure I get the correct size so I can fit the gun in the right position. This is a very large gun, so it's not really a problem. If you are going to use it as a full sized gun, it's a good idea to get a larger size. If you are going to use it for a kid, it's a good idea to get a larger size.

Secondly, if you have a kid who is going to be a little bit older, you need to be careful not to break it off. If you have a kid who is going to be a little bit younger, you may want to take the gun apart. This can be difficult for them to handle, but it's a good idea to put the gun back in the right place.

Thirdly, I need to get the correct size for the gun. I've had some issues with the paint being a bit on the gun and the gun's head not coming off. I'll update this post if I find a better solution.

All in all, I was very happy with this purchase!  It's a great toy!  It's very nice quality, and it's perfect for little hands!Very fun.  Will buy again.This is a good toy for my 2 year old.  She loves to play with it."

1,"Got this product to do our upstairs (only area that is carpeted in our home). Ordered on sale, and got the item promptly through Amazon. Fast forward to 4 months later (we never took it out of the box) and opened it to get to work since we were expecting company. Instructions were horrendous, but finally got the thing put together. My husband and I couldn't figure out why the vac was not standing upright on its own, but kept falling backwards. Figured something must be missing and/or not put together properly. We dumped the Hoover box upside down in an effort to see if there were any missed parts and the only thing that fell out was a teeeeennnnyyyy tiny piece of plastic (think size of a marble). Turns out that little piece of plastic had a big job-it held up the ENTIRE machine. A bit stunned that some genius thought plastic would be good to use for such a crucial part of the machine, I called Hoover expecting them to stand behind their ""One Year Warranty"" that the machine came with. Explained the situation to a Hoover rep who assured me that we could take it to an authorized Hoover store for free repair. I was also confident since the machine was not even used once that the Hoover store could verify that clearly this had not been our fault. Wrong again. We got a phone call 2 days later informing us that the plastic piece that was broken was NOT covered under warranty and it would cost $120.00 to fix. ARE YOU SERIOUS?!?? Oh yes, let's pay for a piece of (*#&(W*#&( machine twice. I think not. This has been the worst experience and I will NEVER purchase anything Hoover again. Cheap plastic, poor design, horrible customer service. Lesson learned the hard way, hope others can learn from our mistake. What a joke!!!! Hoover gets a F- in my book."

1,"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."

1,"Very disappointed in this vx-981K. I had hoped to be able to do a 4k photo burst capture-the menus in the unit are difficult to navigate and understand. The manual is awful, and can't find anything on the website to help. Very misleading as to what this can do. No remote port, so you can't film a show without holding your arm up high on the zoom rocker. I had wanted to mount this on a camera boom arm-but no way to remote control it. I am going to try the Lumix G7 camera, as it has 4K photo burst capture-easy access. And it does have a remote port! When I did film, picture was over-exposed. Not sure if factory set it up this way. Anyway, the build quality seems suspect-SD card slot is underneath unit-can't change it when mounted to tripod! I wish Panasonic would make how-to videos showing all aspects of this video cameras use, instead of 2 minute promo vids with nice music. Even Youtube has mostly unboxing vids. I have used Canon G@0's for years, and Sony products as well, all have remote ports. Not sure why this new trend-maybe using smartphones to control it remotely? Hope this helps."

1,"It is definitely not as big and strong as the industrial cages you find at the gym, but its perfect for a workout room or basement at home.  The cage is relatively light weight, I can easily slide it around or pick it up and move it.  If you are throwing up any amount of weight, the entire cage slides backwards when you throw the bar back to re-rack it on the barbell catches.  It would start sliding on me, but I just pushed it up against the wall.  But the primary reason for only 3 stars is the bench.  The base of the bench is a T shape.  This is great if you are laying back as the legs the jet out provide support.  But when you are sitting up or using the leg extension, you are basically sitting on a rail.  It is wobbily and not sturdy feeling at all.  After two months I have gotten used to it, but I wish the bench was of higher quality.  The seat portion of the bench has 3 settings to incline it, but they are about a quarter inch apart.  The entire seat barely inclines an inch.  When incline benching its hard to fight the sensation that your body wants to slide down the bench.  Also, raising the back is not the easiest thing.  It takes some force.  And finally, the wheels on the back which allow you to roll it down are terrible.  I am 6'3 and I have to lift the bench way up high just to get the wheels to hit the ground.  My wife who is 5'5 can't get it to roll on the wheels.  She practically has to lift the end above her head.  We purchased a rubber mat to put under the unit, so it is a pain to slide the bench on and off the rubber mat.  The cage is great though, its everything I needed for a basement workout area."

1,"This was my first ever quadcopter and I pretty much was sure I would destroy it very quickly after opening it. I'm pretty blown away by this little beast because a) it flies really smoothly and is relatively easy to control, even for a beginner like me. and b) it takes a lickin and keeps on ticking! I've been flying this thing for about a week non-stop now with at least 3-4 total hours of flight time logged so far. (It only gets 5-7 minutes per charge so I've flown it like at least 30 times already) And I have crashed it way over 100 times already. And it has never sustained real damage. 4 stars not 5 because the props do come off REALLY easily and are easily lost. I put a tiny drop of glue on each prop and that has helped a lot. I also tried the Hobbyzone Faze (which looks very similar and has the exact same controller) - but looks are deceiving - this Estes thing blows the Faze out of the sky! The Faze was harder to control, and the Faze died within the first few flights. Meanwhile the Estes keeps on buzzing and delighting us. Yay, Estes! Love this thing!"
1,"recieved free for honest review

60kg for medium sized dogs
retractable dog leash. Made of environmentally protection material TPE. ABS has a nice rubber grasp that is easy to hold and your hand does not slip off.
you press down on the black button to lock  and release to let it go. 4 meter cord.
the light takes three triple a batteries ( you have to provide those)
the light is very bright which I love. I live in the country so it is dark at night to take out the dog it is nice to have a built in light I do not have to search for. you can also take the light off if you want and hold it in your hand. I like to leave it as one piece so I don't lose it.
really well made hard durable plastic and the end of the leash has light reflector so you can be seen in the dark by cars.
I like this one very much and my pomerian who is three pounds can use it just fine."

1,"I really wanted to like this, but it just is awkward to fish with.

The action is somewhat like a fish in it's last moments of life, when it is just occasionally flapping around on the surface on it's side. It is weedless, so I can give it credit for that. Honestly I've had better luck with the frog lures from the same brand. The coloring and look of this sunfish are very accurate, but just know that it ""swims"" on it's side, with the fish hooks facing the sky and the other side of the fish facing the bottom of the lake (weighted), and will never ""swim"" in the normal vertical orientation."
1,"Not great quality - within a few minutes my cats had ripped the toy completely off & I had to superglue it back on. Which meant that replacing the toy would not be an option. Also it's so light weight that the lightest smack knocks it over. Such a great concept & they really wanted to play with it but just not worth the money with the design the way it is.
It may work great for small kittens but do not recommend for adults."
1,"Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead."

1,"I purchased this product because my dishwasher used to always fill up with calcium deposits.  I was cleaning it every two months when the screens and holes in the wands would clog up.  I also had hard water stains on the faucets.

I was very skeptical about whether the product would actually work.  The science is hard to prove!

I installed one of these items on my incoming water supply.  I thought I would start there and then move it to just the hot water side if I wasn't getting the results I wanted.  Since I installed this about 6 months ago, I have never had to clean any calcium from my dishwasher wands.  Yes, I changed out my dishwasher when I installed the Eddy but I really believe I have seen a difference.  I had decided I would spend my budget on the Eddy rather than a top of the line dishwasher since they all seem to clog with the hard water in my area (200 mg/L as CaCO3 or 12 grains).  It appears to have been a good decision for me.

I haven't yet had any problems with hard water so I haven't felt the need to move the unit to just the hot water pipe.

PS:  I installed the unit on my incoming copper water line."
0,I purchased these along with some of the other materials in the carrier. They are strong and sturdy. I had to replace the bowls and then the plastic ones. I used these to make my dog's food.

1,"I have had some bad experiences with cheap carabiners in the past, so when I picked up a pair of these, I was pretty skeptical. However, as I opened these up I immediately noticed the quality construction. The gate is firm, easy to use, and is not sloppy at all. In fact, it feels the same as my Black Diamond Neutrino carabiners. The form of the carabiner looks really solid and in fact at a glance looks like something you'd spend good money on at an outfitter. The Favofits are about a centimeter shorter in length than the Black Diamond, and are noticeably thinner. However, I feel very confident using them for their intended purpose, and that is, of course, hanging my hammock. So perhaps you're sacrificing some load bearing capabilities by not buying a proper climbing biner, but what you lose in load capacity, you gain by this carabiner's ultralight weight. Each comes in at well under an ounce and are among the lightest carabiners in the industry. As a backpacker, I truly appreciate that.

In short, worth it for the weight savings, I don't feel like I'm skimping for my needs, and I'd buy again. In fact, my friend is picking up a pair tomorrow. Excellent.

I was not expecting such an interesting story, but I was intrigued by the beginning of the story and the end. The book is not in the same league as the first book and is still very good. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction. I have been reading the series since the first one was released, and I love the characters and their story. I loved the way the story went about getting the books back on the market. I liked the fact that it was not just a series and it was written in a different style, but it was also a great read. I am a big fan of Ms. King, and I hope she continues to write better. I also like the fact that the story is told from the perspective of the characters and their lives. I think this is one of the best series I have read in a long time."

I really enjoyed the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how each of the characters came to meet and fall in love with one another.

0,"First off, I'm a long-time fan of the wide-angle model.  This is the first one I've owned.  The front sight is very clear, and the rear sight is pretty straight.  I can see in the picture, that it's going to be a bit short for the long-sleeve version, but it will be pretty close.  I haven't really tried it out on a bike yet, but I think it's going to be a good compromise for me.  I haven't shot a lot of bikes, but I'm not sure how long it'll hold up.

Update:  I've had this for about a month now.  It's bright and bright enough to see my neighbors.  I also don't have to worry about the metal going up.  It's just not on the low end of the range.  I've used this for about a month now and it's holding up great.

Highly recommend it.I can't imagine what this movie would have been like if it had been released on DVD. I can't imagine the level of emotion and attention-grabbing violence that could have been put into it. The acting was excellent. I would not have given it five stars if it had been released on DVD. I'm not sure why the producers didn't make it more than five. I have watched it a few times and I'm not sure how they ended up making it three stars, but I don't think I would have given it three.

I think it's worth the money. I think the DVD version is a very good DVD. It was very well done and was well acted. I would recommend it to anyone. I bought the DVD version and it is good.

I'm a big fan of the music and this movie was a must have for me.I am a huge fan of the Beatles and I loved this show. I have seen this series on TV and this one was on my wish list. I have watched it a couple times now and I think it will be on my list for a long time.I was a little disappointed when I purchased this DVD, but I am glad I did. It's a great movie. It's a fun family movie, so you can watch it whenever you want."
1,"I'm an Oprah junkie, so I absolutely loved this. Her whole background is so tragic. I knew quite a bit about her before reading this, but I definitely learned more details. I had no idea she had a brother that died and that was a very sad story. The last chapter on life lessons from Oprah is worth keeping somewhere for inspiration. Great intro read into Oprah world."
0,"This dog bone is okay. It's a very thin bone, and my dog loves to scratch. The shape is a nice, solid shape, and the shape is great. The color is beautiful and the material is soft. The construction is very sturdy. The material is soft and plush. I will probably buy another one. If I had to guess, I'd say this is the best dog bone I've found for the price. This is a great product for dogs that need something to chew on. I love that it is made in the USA. I am very happy with this purchase. I have a 15 lb. lab mix, and I like this collar to allow him to chase his prey, and also to let him know when he is ready to return. It also seems to help him get a good grip on the leash. I would recommend this collar for dogs who need to be able to stay in a leash. I have a large dog, and he is always chasing after his prey. He is very strong, and this collar is a great option for him. He is also very playful with it. It is very easy to adjust, and he gets to it quickly."

1,"I ordered one of these curious about the comparison to the Honeywell product.  If you haven't noticed (by reading the reviews) this is not the same product that Honeywell delivers with their air filtration unit.

The filter that came with my unit was a bit stiffer in construction when compared to this replacement filter but, I'm fairly confident that this replacement will provide similar performance.  It is identically sized, and seems to have the same filtration capabilities (or darn close) to the actual Honeywell product.

I'll order this again, and feel confident in suggesting that you give it a chance."
1,Smiths books are extremely long so give yourself time to get lost in her stories! I love her writing. This first book in the LoA series was really good and I loved the relationships between the beings of Arcadia and the h. I like fantasy/paranormal and relationships between humans and other beings/creatures don't bother me at all. If you are not a fan of that than you won't enjoy Smiths books. She is a master at world building and grabbing you and not letting go long after you finish reading.

I've had his teeth cleaned a few times but because of other health issues that he has, I don't want to put him under anesthesia unless completely necessary. I now scrape his teeth weekly, use coconut oil and a sonicare toothbrush for brushing and Dentahex for his final rinse. His teeth look great and now his breath smells better then ever! I love this product and its great minty smell. It's all of my dogs favorite part of their nightly routine... not sure if its because they knows that it's the last step before I leave their mouth alone or that they love the taste?

I'm very happy with this product.I just installed a new shower head with this kit.  I have a well built shower head that uses a lot of water pressure, so I was worried about the water pressure coming out of the head.

But if you are looking for more from a cookbook than the same recipes using the same ingredients and the same techniques and the same combinations... Well, don't expect that here. I like cleavage though and she does make sure to include that so I'll throw in a star for that. ;-) In fairness, if this was her first book, I'd view it more favorably, but she is traveling a well-beaten track at this point."

1,"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.

Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.

Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.

Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!

Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games."

But it IS really nice, the scales are embroidered on irridescent fabric, the eye and freckles(?) are printed...it feels nice and touchable, and will probably outlast my kids's childhoods, but it's not going to fit in their kitchen - it's about twice as big as I think it should be in scale with the rest of the Biofino line...However, it will be fabulous as the 'little fish' counterpart to the big blue Jennifer Strunge fish we have from Land of Nod, it fits nicely inside that big fish's mouth - makes a kind of hilariously awesome set..."

1,"I love the concept. I found some of the stories more engaging than others. The problem with short stories is that there's sometimes not enough time to care about the characters and really feel their despair and visceral urge for revenge. ""Until Death Do Us Part"" was most effective, because everybody can empathize with a bride on her wedding day. The BPD reception was something I'll never forget! Probably everyone can relate to the road rage sketch and will enjoy living vicariously (and laughing in shock) through the fantasy. ""The Proposal"" was a little too long--the least satisfying and most boring of the tales. Revolved mostly around greed and entitlement, which don't interest me. ""Pasternak"" was interesting but too unlikely to make a serious impact (no pun intended). ""Rats"" was pretty good. The one about the demolition guy was okay. Honestly, I might give this 3.5 stars. But I'm not at all sorry I rented it."
1,"Our puppy LOVED this duck- being a duck dog himself, he bonded with this duck immediately.  They were the best of buds.  Mr. Mallard was our puppy's go-to toy for quite a while.  It was easy to wash and pretty dang cute, too.  That is, until our pup hit puberty and learned that he could destroy things.  Mr, Mallard here lasted longer that I expected he would.  He put up a pretty good fight against the shark-tooth puppy.  But it was only a matter of time...

If your dog isn't a toy destroyer, this is a GREAT deal.  Otherwise, prepare for a duck funeral or go with a Kong heavy-duty toy."

1,"When I heard there was going to be a Jurassic Park III, I thought it would suck. The ending to ""The Lost World"" was a great way to end the series. So I figured it would suck and give Jurassic Park a bad name. I was wrong. This one had the most action and was the most intense one in the series. I would give it 5 stars,but you just can't compare it to to the previous two. I was real glad to see Sam Neil return as Dr. Grant. He may not be the most popular actor, but he's a good one. The special effects were great as usual. ""The Lost World's"" visuals weren't a whole lot better than the first one, but you can tell a significant difference in Jurassic Park III. The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts. For one example, the ending when the army and Navy showed up to rescue them. It was to unrelistic. The movie is still great though. It's a great conclusion and ending to a wonderful movie series."

Had a blackout and now it is blinking 12:00. The internal battery died. I can't find the manual so I'm looking online to try to reset it. This clock has been the biggest pain in the derriere I have every owned.

It's relatively simple to dismantle and clean, plus it's dishwasher safe, so you can get it especially clean if you want to. I'm glad we went with the Breville. I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

I actually purchased another straight away. I will just have to remember to take it off every time I hope it lasts a while. Now, on the replacement, I cannot really say how well it lights my way because it is flooding in Houston and I'm not riding. But, the seller sent an email to ask me to review (I do loathe this new practice, as I typically don't use such products that soon and I HATE getting extra emails-like I don't get enough already). For this practice I dinged a star just because I hate the reminder so very much. I rate my products in groups as time permits, not as soon as I get it. Ridiculous."

1,"I will start this by saying that my son looked awesome in this costume and the outfit itself is really great.  He got so many compliments, mostly from dads.  I think people appreciate seeing a kid dressed up as a normal person rather than a TV character or something.

The problem with this costume was with the cap:  it was misshapen and hard to keep on his head.  I tried to contact the company to get a replacement for the cap but had no luck.  I would have had to return to Amazon.  I bought too close to Halloween and the rest of the costume was so cute, we just kept it and he still looked great."

1,"I came across this  book by accident and boy, am I glad I did.  It is a dark fantasy based on Nordic mythology, I think - but it did  not matter at all that I know next to nothing on the subject.  It felt like wandering in a situation, in the course of a walk in the wilderness - everything was normal but yet was not.  All apparently 'normal' protagonists had this underneath shadowy existence.  The pace was slow, like it happens in dreams but also just right.  Nothing was as it appeared at first.  A wonderful darkly joyous story.  Thank you Alex."

I purchased it for a beach vacation and got one days use out of it--however, the color bled and stained my skin underneath the suit.

Only recommend this product if you're going to lay it flat on the floor. If you're trying to stick to a wall, forget about it. It WILL not stay.

Very solid and well-made product. Took some getting used to stuffing speaker cable inside. I used the entire length and didn't need to cut into. Worked out very nicely after all was said and done. The double-side tape took a minute to get the backing off, but once I did, it was SUPER STRONG. Hopefully, it stays stuck to my tile flooring and I never have to worry about unsightly cables again. Much thicker than I had anticipated."

0,This staple gun is easy to assemble and the finish is good.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are too small to fit into the jaws.

1,"I am in awe of this series, I cannot get enough of this story.

There was so much going on in this installment, I again was so elated that I waited for all the books to be out so no waiting for the next one. Each cliffhanger in the series is bigger than the last.

Jase knows who ""Sammi"" is now. How did he find out ? Will he tell Dornan? Is he truly still the boy that Juliette loved, still loves? Is he on her side?

It was like I was holding my breath with Juliette waiting for Jase to figure it out. Then he does and I felt relief and then much like Juliette I felt despair at the consequences now that Jase knows. What a roller coaster ride of emotions!

Lili St. Germain knows how to tell a gripping story that's for sure.

Moved right on to the next book."

1,"I purchased this Relaxing Sofa Bean Bag Folding Sofa Chair, Futon Chair & Lounge in white by E-joy and I really like it so far. I ordered it on the 10th and it was delivered on the 17th, so that's pretty good free shipping in my opinion. I was worried I'd have to wait weeks for it, but it arrived in good time and in perfect condition. It comes folded over and has a little belt and clip that holds it closed. Once removed, in unfurled and I was glad it see it looked just like in the picture, a nice cream color, but mine did come with two pillows not one. It did have a slight chemical factory smell, but I've been letting it air out in the living room with all of the windows opened and that's helped already. My only complaint is that the different positions of the recliner don't really click into place. Like, you can hear the click when it's in position, but when I lean back on it, it just goes to the farthest back setting, so it's not really adjustable unless you have it pushed back against a wall to hold it in place. It is really comfortable though and I can definitely see myself taking naps on this in the very near future.

1,"I will say it up front, yes this was a film never previously seen in America, maybe it still has not been. It is from the 1970's, and just about outdoes most other genre entries (no pun intended) in terms of the degree of sleaze radiating off the screen.

Another film where you could speed the film up 4-5 times and quite easily follow the plot, what little there is of it.

I found it interesting to study the eyes of the people 'acting' in this film, there is a lot of uneasiness amid the sleaze on show.

It is really a straight porn shoot (and it is without a doubt X-rated) with one or two lesbian scenes which would have been pretty radical for those days (I'm guessing).

To give an indication of the story and plot standard, the short sex scenes which were often threatening to break out into a very laid back orgy, well those X-rated scenes were the actual highlight of the entire mess on show.

It must have cost a fair bit to make, as it is well shot for the era, and whoever was behind the camera had at least some idea of what they were doing.

I cannot comment on the dialogue as I couldn't bear to expose myself to it (it was dubbed anyway I think, which compounds the agony).

And if you are thinking of purchasing this DVD based on the jacket featuring a gorilla obviously rather taken with a diverting buxom blonde, you will be sadly disappointed.

There is a lame sex scene involving the bloke in the gorilla suit, with a young woman who obviously is unhappy, does not want her face caught on film, and raises the possibility whether she was aware of what was going on or even whether she felt under a little duress during that scene.

Which brings me back to the central point, yes, this is sleaze with a capital 'S'; you sort of do get what was advertised, but it is so tame and takes itself seriously by today's 'standards' it is almost quaint."

1,"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway."

1,"I bought my daughter 4 pairs of these little boots this winter. They're just so perfect. They are so warm and super comfy. She's excited to have boots just like mommy too!

1,"The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to."

Set in the open mike clubs of L.A. Jack and Kyle suffer misadventure after misadventure looking for ""insparado"" (the secret behind great song writing) and their next gig.
Like Spinal Tap, these guys are talented but have no idea how insipid and dumb their material is.  They perform with great energy and that raises them far above the songs they are singing.  In one episode Jack and Kyle are trying to write a new song and the melody is farmiliar.

1,"**UPDATED**
I adjusted the watch band by taking out one link and it was the most difficult watch I have ever adjusted.  I have watch tools and have adjusted, fixed and worked on a number of watches and other jewelry.  Getting the pin back in proved extremely difficult.  Once you pull it out the other piece of the band moves and it is very difficult to line it back up and get the pin inserted again.  typically this is a 5-10 minute job but with this watch it took hours.  After wearing the watch for 2 weeks, it literately fell off my wrist one day.  Lest you think I did not adjust it properly, it was the other side of the band not even close to the the adjustment I made.  I was not doing anything strenuous either, unless you consider typing on a laptop strenuous.  Because of this I have had to downgrade my rating for 4 to 2 stars.  Very disappointing!

If you are looking for a nice looking watch with little options at a good price this might be the watch for you.  This watch will not give you the date, does not have a faceplate light or glow, but it does keep good time and it looks very nice.  It is lighter weight than you might expect but seems to hold up fine with normal wear.  If you are concerned about a watch you can wear in the pool or need to see the date this isn't for you.  Overall this is good watch for the guy who wants to not spend a lot but have a good looking watch on his wrist.

I have been wearing it nearly every day since it arrived and have been quite happy with it."
1,"The brow piece on this helmet (by the photo) is TOTALLY inaccurate.

The brow piece on a typical Roman style Imperial helm (pick whichever century you want) has the brow guard AT THE BROW, about 1 inch up from lower edge and goes around the helmet stopping above the ears.

The brow guard on this helmet is flimsy looking, a bent piece of metal that would easily get smashed off and offers no protection to the forehead.

The sole is hard but contoured with more than adequate arch support, however if you aren't used to the molded Birkenstock footbed, I would avoid these boots as they are not the best for a lot of walking. The shearling lining is very soft and very warm, however the top of the boot is floppy so a little bit of that harsh winter breeze sneaks in at the ankles. Overall the boot looks good on, and the opening is wide enough for socks and skinny jeans.

1,"These gloves fit really snug (Medium). I had tried some on at a local shop in Large, which I knew would be too big (baggy in the fingertips). I also took the advice of another rider who reminded me that most gloves stretch a bit over time. Despite being tough to get on and off, they didn't bind and were very comfortable when riding my recumbent or my upright.

I had hoped they'd be a little warmer, but overall I still like them.

Only real complaints:

--The velcro strap at the wrists is small and looks flimsy. I can see this breaking in the future. On the upside, they are so snug and have a little bit of a ""cuff"" so even if the strap breaks the gloves would be perfectly functional (the strap is almost superfluous).

--I would have expected a longer cuff towards the wrists for a winter-intended glove, and one they advertise as water resistant. Getting a jacket over the cuff really won't work very well: isn't long enough and no real edge to keep the jacket cuff from riding up your arm. Thankfully, I have dedicated rain gloves for wet riding.

UPDATE 3/21/17: downgraded from 4 stars to 3
The outside of the index finger on the gloves is wearing through, especially the right glove. I assume this is because of shifting or perhaps some other abrasion? It may seem harsh to downgrade from 4 to 3 stars after a little over 3 years of daily use for 6 months a year, but there was a time when even inexpensive cycling gloves would last many more years than this, so it's a bit of a disappointment.

I will likely not buy again, might see what Giro has to offer (since I like their Zero gloves for the summer)."

1,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.
All I Want for Christmas is a Duke is an anthology about women who fall in love with dukes and their love is finally returned around Christmas time.
The first story The Duke and Duchess Trap reminded me of the Parent Trap story. The duke and duchess have twin girls and when they separate, each one takes a daughter. The girls meet a few years later in a boarding school. On Christmas break, they both return to the other parent. To get the correct daughter back, the parents must reunite.
Sophie and the Duke revolves around a duke looking for a wife by having a masked ball. He meets a childhood friend at the ball but he doesnt remember her right away. As time goes on, he gets a few clues as to who she is and realizes that she still intrigues him.
A scientific formula is the basis of The Dukes Christmas Wish. The Duke of Vale comes up with a marriage formula to get accepted into society, except he didn't figure love into the equation.
Lady Patience helps out a person stranded in a snowstorm in One Magic Season. Unbeknownst to her, it is an old flame of hers. But she cant leave him stranded to freeze. So she faces her fears and insecurities to offer him a place to stay until the storm abates.
I loved all of these stories. All good reads and clean romance. I would recommend to all romance lovers."

1,"This bag is great. I have all kinds of bike bags because none really worked that well for my needs. They were either, two small or inconvenient to use. This one has a tremendous amount of space without using the expansion. It is also shaped well so it doesn't interfere with pedaling. ie your thigh doesn't hit it. Not only do I have the normal tools but I have put my big ass kryptonite chain and lock in the bag, all without using the expansion and I still have room to put a wallet and keys in there! I never use exclamation points by the way. The mounting/compression straps and connectors work well. It seems durable as well. It is so great that I plan to buy two more for other bikes."

1,"Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess."

1,"I purchased one of these at Wal-Mart for $10.00. In my 50's now I always wanted to have one. I don't know why some people had issues or put it down. First off I sent for the ants which cost another $5.00 for S&H right through the website. It took 10 days to receive them, keep in mind if you live somewhere it's cold or too hot you will wait longer. After receiving the ants, only one dead one, I followed the instructions closely. First making 4 starter tunnles with the tool and then cooling down the ants in the fridge for 15 minutes then putting them in. It took less the 24 hours and the ants started working. Each ant has different jobs. Some dig, some remove debris and some just stand guard near the lid. Someone reviewed it didn't light up well; maybe they didn't put batteries in it! Mine lighted up well! The only hard part to this is the fact you have to put the whole farm in the refrigerator for at least 75 minutes to slow the ants up to clean out the debris as they are very fast and will try to escape. I have it 3 weeks so far and lost maybe 5 ants as they do die off and do not lay eggs since there is no queen. Like any other creature sometimes they dig other times they rest.  I do believe its fun to watch and well worth the 10 bucks. I guess I'm a kid at heart, get one and enjoy the fun!"

1,"Dell laptops are not as evil as the 3 lower comments make them seem.  It takes some basic user knowledge to get accustomed with the product.  There is no need to 'knock' Dell down because of a bad user experience.

Blue screens are usually caused by bad programming or writing of software.  Blue screens have codes that say ""error: xxx""  where XXX is the name and code of the problem.  MOST bluescreens are MEMORY PARITY problems -- bad programming of software.

Dell not responding to customer issues is absurd.  I have never had that experience in the 15 years I've been contacting Dell for any situation.

My suggestion to people who have ""so much trouble"" is to figure out why others do not.  You may not realize that installing and uninstalling through the Windows installer is the proper way to install.  Installing through each individual programs installer is WRONG.  This advice will fix 9% of problems out there dealing with ""my laptop is slow now!"""

1,"Bwa ha ha -- the master of the midnight movie is back, after far too long an absence from the scene, with what one might actually accept as the ultimate ""grrl power"" flick.

But acceptance is not Henenlotter's purpose here.  His aim as usual is to entertain, shock, and amuse, and he attains his goals on his accustomed shoe-string budget.

Indeed, part of the fun of this DVD is listening to the commentary, in which the outre auteur and his young white-boy-rapper producer describe the guerilla movie-making techniques they employed to realize this bizarre sexual fantasy.  The fact that they accidentally set fire to the 150-year-old mansion they rented for a whopping $4,000 as the film's primary location -- and then extinguished the flame with diet soda -- gives you some clue that this was not a normal shoot!

And then there are the purple-hued ""penis-cam"" shots...

Suffice it to say that if you enjoy ""Something Weird"" videos, you will likely enjoy this film, which also features one of the most tragic ""happy endings"" you will ever see.

As the director says on the commentary, at the consummation of this unusual love story, ""Now there's something you don't see every day.""  That's what makes this film -- and Henenlotter himself -- so special..."

1,"I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient."

1,"This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser."

1,"The Fulcrum 30030-308 wireless remote LED light is a simple and effective way to add light to a room or a closet that doesn't already have a light and a light switch. It's a battery-operated setup and remarkably easy to install with double-backed tape.

In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.

My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.

Bottom line, this works and I'm mostly happy with it, but I'd be even happier if the light fixture was ""flatter"" from front to back and the remote light switch was smaller."

1,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop."

I had no issues with the carpeting on the car. This is a great product for the money. I love these shorts!  I wear size 10 and they fit perfectly. They are very comfortable and I can wear them as a calf. I like that they are not too tight and they are not too tight. They are very comfortable and I feel that they are a very good addition to my wardrobe. I do recommend these shorts for any man who is looking for a good pair of shorts. Very nice leather belt. It is very comfortable. Very comfortable for my arm. My wife wears a medium. My husband is wearing a medium. They are very well made and very comfortable. Works as advertised. This is my second pair of glasses, and I really like the quality of the material. The material is thin and very soft, and it's comfortable to wear. The material is very durable, and it's a nice color. I have not had any issues with sun damage, but it's a bit of a problem when I first got these. I received these after I bought my second pair. The colors are good, and the color matched my previous pair, which is my second pair. I love the black and gold ones, and the blue ones are very comfortable."

I've had this for about a year and I still mess up sometimes and accidentally hitting the insert button instead of delete. Cons? The button placement. Lifespan of the batteries in the number pad (it's been dead for a while, but the keyboard is still operating on the same batteries that came with it). Doesn't fit in a keyboard tray correctly.

Knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn't have bought it, but it works good enough for me to keep using it."

I was intrigued by the description of the book. It sounded like an interesting story about overcoming adversity...While I understand that nobody is perfect, I felt that each of the main characters should have known better.  Also, there were a lot of unneccesary parts which made the ""story"" drag on and on.  After investing more so mch time in this story, I expected something more out of the ending!

That said, I think the narrator did a great job and her reading of each character was very distinct!"

1,"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me."
0,"Awesome showerhead, I was concerned that it might be too tight for my hand, but I was just about ready to go. The shower head is very small, and the cover is very large. I was concerned about the head falling out, but it's not really that big. The shower head is a bit smaller than I expected, but I can't tell you how long it will last. I just wish it was a bit longer, and it will be fine. Overall, I am very happy with this showerhead. It's really nice to have it, and I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a better showerhead than the one I bought. I am very happy with it. I got this to replace an old wall lamp with a new one. It's a great little light, the only drawback is the metal screws are a bit too long for my small hand. I'm hoping this will last a long time."

My favorite part is the HEIGHT at which they are installed. Because they are lights - they are installed higher which gives you a better angle for faces.  The Ring system is typically LOW and I didn't like the angles."

I recently received a Survival Bracelet Kit by Sahara Sailor for a product review.

The kit itself looked very nice with the orange/grey paracord, but I will admit I hated to take it apart because I figured I couldn't put it back together.  However, I got this for a product review so I proceeded to take it apart.

I paid attention to the steps I took, even taking pictures, and slowly took the kit apart.  I dumped out the contents, and everything seemed to be there - a pretty neat little kit of various items.  The flashlight has a piece of plastic on the battery, once you remove that it works fine.

To my own surprised, I was actually able to put the full kit together - it didn't look as nice as it did when I got it, but still looked pretty good.  Overall this is a neat little kit that would be a great novelty gift, and could actually come in handy depending on the person.  Since you can put it back together, you could swap the contents for whatever you felt was useful.

Bottom line: Nice little kit, and if you are careful you can put it back together."

Generally my hubby can make ANYTHING work, and he did with this, but lets just say you better start off as a happy couple beforehand because this thing was a b*tch.  Now that it's all done, sitting sturdily, I might add, in our entryway, we're thrilled.  We really like how it looks, the two of us can sit on it at the same time, we hang everything up there, leashes, coats, basket of bandannas on the top shelf, shoes on the bottom, sunglasses up top, you name it.

I would recommend to anyone that is interested in this product.I purchased this item for my son's room in his house. He loves it. He loved it and it was great!

The only thing I am not happy about is the color of the cover. It is a dark brown and I like it. I have to say it is not bright for my taste. I had a few issues with it. I have to say it is a good product.

My husband and I have been very pleased with this product. I have used it for many years. I bought a couple of similar models and they are great. I have always wanted something to replace my old doorbell but I have not had one yet. I plan to buy another one as a backup.This is a very nice device.  I was worried that it was going to be a big deal and not something I would use on a regular basis.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was because it is very bulky.

The flashlight is very bright and well made. The light is a bit large for my size but still very bright. I love it. I have also purchased the 3-way adapter and it is a great deal. I have had no problems with the flashlights and am very happy with the purchase. I am very pleased with this purchase. I hope the light has a longevity of a year.

I have a number of other flashlights and this one fits my needs perfectly. I have not had a problem with any of them. I would recommend this flashlight to anyone. I would also recommend that you read the reviews. I have used this flashlight for many years and have never had a problem. I would recommend it to anyone.I have owned two of these. One is a standard 6 volt battery. The other is a lithium ion.

The battery is made of 4 different components. The inside of the battery is plastic, the inside is metal, and the inside is a plastic shell.

It was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it. I watched this movie with my son, who is 6 months old. I am a big fan of the movies, and I have watched them over and over. I have watched them a few times, and he has been very impressed. I will watch the movie again, and the movie will not be as good as the first one. I don't know why the movie was not rated R.

1,"Back in 2011 I got a chance to read Because of You by Jessica Scott. This is where you first meet Shane Garrison and Jen St. James. I strongly suggest you read that story first, before jumping into this novella. However, it is just a suggestion. Here's why:

In Anything for You Shane and Jen have been together for sometime. Shane is about to do something and he's afraid to tell Jen what he is about to do. I don't know what the man was thinking when he thought it was a good idea not to tell Jen. Fortunately, he has a good buddy who has talked some sense into him. I know this is very vague, but it's a novella. If I say to much, I might tell the whole story. Plus, a lot of the background is in the first book of the  Coming Home series. Overall, it is a quick read (seriously) in which you get to see Shane and Jen work out there relationship and over come there fears of what could happen. It was enjoyable and it's nice to see Jen and Shane again. So, I actually hope you get to read both stories Because of You and Anything for You. So, I leave you today and I hope it's wonderful."
1,"This is one of the absolute best party games ever.  I bought A2A at a local game shop on a whim years ago.  My Amazon purchase was the big set for a friend and his family.  Be prepared for hours of fun.

Here is the general idea:

First, get a group of people wanting some social fun
Second, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are)
Third, start with someone called the ""jusdge"" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are)
Fourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.

The person who is the round's ""judge"" tosses out a card that is a descriptor.  Let's say that the word is ""Hot.""  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a word that embodies ""hot.""  One player might toss in ""Marylin Monrow"" and another might toss in ""The Sun.""  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!

This is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.

Note: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries."

I'm sure she will like it even more as she grows.I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this.

0,Another stellar book from MD. The characters are well developed and believable. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in medicine and social work. I'm a fan of this book and I look forward to reading it. I enjoy the mystery genre and the characters. I like to read with a sense of humor. I enjoy having a good time with the characters and just wanting to get to know them better. I enjoyed this book a lot and will be reading more of her work. I enjoyed this book. It was a little confusing at times but it was well written. I really liked the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how the two different families formed. I loved how the family was represented and how it was different. I liked that the book was made into a book about a group of people who were on a quest to solve the mystery of a woman who is missing. I liked that the author made the whole mystery about the missing woman into a book about the families. The book was fun to read and I was very excited to read the next book. I have read all of her books and have enjoyed all of them. This one is my favorite. I am now reading the rest.

The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable. We have 2 kids with it and it has held up great. It is a little heavier than I expected, but it has held up well. The only negative I have is that it is very cheap. I bought another one for my husband. He does not like it at all. He likes it and will probably get another one for his friend. Great product and works great. It is a little difficult to use, but it works. I would recommend this to anyone."

1,"This knife was issued to me and the battalion I was attached to with the USMC (FMF Corpsman) Why not a K-bar? Not sure. But this was a great knife! Shaves hairs off of your arm out of the box. Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars. If you want a super durable knife, that is strong and American made, get an actual Ka-Bar. They are about the same price depending where you get it."

But, an early morning New Year's Day murder threatens to bring Sam's inner circle to their knees. As they close ranks to find the killer, leaks to the media make it all the more personal to Sam.

Nick starts his first day as VP wondering what role the administration really wants him to play. He's feeling a bit left in the dark. He is resenting being used to boost the President's approval rating.

Scotty is becoming more entrenched in the lives of Sam and Nick.  They can't imagine their lives without one another. But, what will happen when something threatens the adoption?

1,"I'm going to be completely honest and say I'm still trying to figure out if this book was just ok or just something that could have been ok but left me feeling like it was missing quite a bit it had too many cliches.

Jagger comes from not so great of a childhood and Tatiana comes from a childhood of abuse, so they have something in common which is the crappy childhoods. And of course, it's what brings them together which is maybe what I found so cliche.

He's an ""underground"" fighter and has been in trouble with the law yet he is the one who gets in trouble because he tries to help her.

I don't want to do spoilers so the best I can say is - it's sad when you know exactly what direction a story is heading and you keep reading hoping every cliche won't be used.

I had seen the movie version several times and in my opinion I really enjoyed the book so much more (Although the movie earns it's own merit's). It left me speechless and it really made me think about what Scarlett O'Hara had been through and it really made me for feel her and the other characters in the story. I was really impressed with the story Margaret Mitchell created. I can see why this got the Pulitzer Prize in 1937.

1,"We were lucky enough to receive the Fisher Price Little People City Skyway from Fisher Price for free to check out. My kids (3.5 yer old girl and 17 month old boy) were absolutely enthralled when they saw the box. I could not open it fast enough and then, I could not build it fast enough. Building took some time but overall was easy enough (just need a screw driver). Everything is labeled nicely. My husband says they need to include an extra screw (because he lost one).

I will admit, I was skeptical about this toy. We had seen it in Target previously and my kids were attracted to it like moths to a flame. I remember thinking, ""ummm, not going to happen. One trick pony toy."" However, I'm happy to report, I was super wrong. My kids LOVE this. They've been playing with it everyday, multiple times during the day.

Pros:
-It's huge. Like nearly as  tall as my 3.5 year old huge. Definitely taller than the boy.
-It comes with two cars, Koby and Tessa.
-You don't have to wait for one car to finish before you start the other (essential for the sharing challenged).
-It fits other Little People cars.
-You can slide other cars or things down the ramps (like Octonauts for example).
-The cars can go to three separate exits and they can either go down the ramps on their own or the kids can switch them.
-It really does inspire imaginative play with a fueling station, stop light, crane and gate.
-It spans the ages nicely.
-No batteries!!!!
-Sturdy. Doesn't fall over easily and seems like it could take a pretty good beating at the hands of children.

Cons:
-It IS big so if space is limited this could take up precious space. If your kid is really into cars though, it's totally worth it.

All in all, this is worth the asking price. Would make a fantastic holiday or just because present!"

I searched and searched the Amazon.com for the perfect Rose Ring for me:  The Poet.  This definitely turned out to be the perfect Rose Ring for me.  I purchased it for $45.99.  I was a little afraid when I ordered this that the rose would sit up too high.  But is does not.  It is a very enjoyable ring to wear.  I purchased it in a 7  thinking that I would wear it on my middle finger.  But it ended up fitting my left index finger perfect and I love wearing it on that hand.  Here is my meditation for this ring:

The Poet's Silver Rose Ring of Marcasite
Oh, there are some tales of those days of old
During the rush west in search for gold.
There was a rebellion
Led by Nevada women
To wear not gold but marcasite:
Beauty in what was of plenty seemed right.
The Poet wears a silver rose ring of marcasite;
Supporting this Nevada cause so right!

The hotel was built in the late 19th century and was owned by the wealthy Charles LeBarre.  This is a wonderful story about the true story of the hotel owner and his wife, the owner of the Marigold Hotel.  It is a very entertaining documentary that gives a strong picture of the hotel owner's life and how he managed to survive his gambling addiction.  The documentary does a great job of giving us a glimpse into his life, and the real life that he was in his 30's.  It is a wonderful story of the hotel owner and his wife.I loved this movie. It was a good movie and I was impressed with the story. It was not the best of the bunch. I think the ending was a little hard to follow.This is a movie that is good for kids.

1,"I saw The Suitor at the Sacramento French Film Festival this year, and bought the whole collection for the Sacramento Alliance Francaise.  Pierre Etaix has a deadpan comedy style much like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.  Some of his film, like The Suitor, could easily have been silent films.  The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.  The film becomes a talkie only when the action takes place after talkies were invented."

I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

This pair of TRUFORM like the others I have bought in the past did not have a SIZE tag in them.

My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars."

Life is good!!  Haha. I now have my perfect 4 min. poached eggs again. Put a little water or butter in the cups and the eggs slide right out.  The pan is very useful for me.  I reheat food in it, make sauces, cook small quantities of anything.  Washes up easily! Cups wash right up.

1,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them."

I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.  Incidentally, the instructions accompanying this opener warned that it might not be able to remove some corks, so it would probably be a good idea to hold onto your old corkscrew.

Waterproof so far and pretty warm! Except on wet metal (loader steps) very slip resistant. The laces are waayy too short so I had to replace them.
I had a very hard time trying to find good women's work boots with steel toe so I'm ecstatic to finally have some that had great reviews at a decent price and so far so good!

I lowered to a 3 from a 5.  The first pair were great but the second pair I bought took months to break in and caused so many blisters.  The waterproofing failed in one shoe fairly quickly so rainy days at work suck."
1,"This product is unfortunately junk. The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils. I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend."
0,"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who"

1,"I'm a writer, and this book, this introduction to another culture, is beautifully written. There were times that I became so emotionally involved with this book that I had to put it down and do something else. It's a novel. But I believe it to be autobiographical, too. If you ever had any questions about India, this is for you."
1,"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon."

1,we installed it ourselves and it seems to work great. We never had a disposal before so we did go to Home Depot and get this thing that plugs into the outlet and has a button attached that we installed on the countertop. The button uses air pressure to turn the outlet off and on so that the disposal will operate without a hardwired switch.

1,"This was one of the last gifts opened because it looked like a lot of work! We got it for 3 year olds and probably should have waited a year! Not all Hotwheels fit in the Turbo shooter thing, and the track does not hold together too well when cars come out of it and are sent into the u turn.

I am very pleased with the price and I am very happy with the purchase.  I highly recommend it!I had to have it to watch this movie.  I just watched it with my friends and it was really good.  It's very sad that they lost their father.  You have to see this movie to understand why it was so bad.  You will not be sorry.  This movie was a terrible mess.  We were in for a bad day.  We got a huge dose of cheesy teen sex and a lot of nudity.  I was really upset by this movie.  I didn't even get to see it.  I don't really know what the problem was.  I guess this movie was a masterpiece that was not made for children.  The acting was good, the story was good, but it was not worth the money.  This movie was not for the average person.

1,"First thing I noticed is that the escutcheon *looks* nice with the nickel finish, but it is cheap plastic.  I have no doubt that after a few good cleanings, even the most modest of scrubbing pads would leave this looking awful.

Second thing is that it didn't even fit.  I'm replacing an original Moen trim kit.  My originial sits flush to the wall.  This one has about a 3.5"" ring that needs to be recessed into the wall by 1/4"" - not something easy to accomplish on an existing tile wall.  I have about a 2"" diameter hole where the valve comes out, but it's not big enough.  You can see what I'm talking about in the product picture - where the handle is attached, you can see that circle there and how it is recessed.

The one nice thing (not that it benefitted me at all) is that this kit tries to replace both old & new Moen configurations by providing several inserts to choose from.  This way you can match it to most Moens regardless of how your current one screws in to the valve.

I'm looking for a different kit that 1) sits flush and 2) might have a more durable faceplate."
1,I just received this today and as soon as my daughter saw this (2.5 yrs old) she was soooooo excited! She has just started getting into Barbies and i knew shed love this car. Right out of the box it is pretty much all set to go besides the side mirrors and some stickers but she was off pushing it around everywhere within minutes of opening it and putting those few small details on! The toy itself seems to be made really well and i see it lasting for the years she plays with barbies and possibly lasting long enough for her to save and give to her daughter to use if she has one in the future.
1,"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way."

Hopefully she'll come back to this world and write more sometime."
1,"Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived."

1,"Thoroughly enjoyed this book.  With each new book in the series, the characters are growing.  This book was different as it was based upon an attack of an Irish rugby hero who isn't dead but is comatose and is married to a well known and loved TV personality.  The mystery was trying to figure out who would want to hurt him and why.

Reilly, Chris and Kennedy struggle to figure it out through all the media hype involving the famous couple.  The forensics crew are working long hard hours going over all the evidence and coming up with very little to go on and a few unknowns...but they are all very intelligent in their own ways and eventually things slowly begin to come together.

In this story, you also get to see a different side of Reilly, as she tries to work through both her personal problems and her career problems.

This was an excellent read and I hope there are more to come ... and soon!  Thank you to the Hill's for this wonderful series,"
